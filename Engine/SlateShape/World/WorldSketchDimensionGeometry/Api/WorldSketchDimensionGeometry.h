// 🧩 What a dimension LOOKS like — the witness lines, the dimension line, the arrows and where the figure
//    sits — recomputed from the live geometry every single time it is asked.
//
// 🔴 A DIMENSION STORES NO COORDINATES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. It holds a reference to what it
//    measures and an offset saying how far to the side to draw. Everything else on screen is derived
//    here, from scratch, from the geometry as it stands right now. So a dimension CANNOT go stale and
//    CANNOT drift off the thing it measures: resize the shape and the dimension follows, because there
//    was never a stored position to become wrong. The alternative -- caching the endpoints when the
//    dimension is placed -- is the classic annotation bug, and it is unfixable once the cache exists.
//
// 🔴 THE OFFSET'S SIGN IS THE SIDE IT DRAWS ON. It is a projection onto the edge's perpendicular, so
//    dragging across the edge makes it negative and the whole dimension flips over. Nothing branches on
//    which side the pointer is; the arithmetic already knows.
//
// 📝 Pure geometry, in millimetres, in world space. No camera, no pixels, no text formatting -- the
//    caller projects and draws. That is what makes every claim below provable without a device.
