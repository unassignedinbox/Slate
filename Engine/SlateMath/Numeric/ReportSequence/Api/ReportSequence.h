/// note  🔴 The disposition is declared by the reporting mechanism and never inferred from the text. An inferred
///        disposition is a presentation that disagrees with the document that made the promise — `86` §4.1.
/// note  Five of the seven describe normal operation. `86` §5 is the authority on which of them is a problem,
///        and a presenter that treats all seven as failures teaches the artist to ignore it.
