///        property in object space, so a chart flattens identically wherever the occupant sits and an artist
///        moving a scene re-derives nothing here.
/// note  🔴 The boundary loop is supplied rather than discovered. A chart with more than one loop is not a disc
///        and cannot be flattened at all; the caller resolves that by subdividing, which is `68` §4.1's response
///        to a fold and is deliberately the same mechanism.
