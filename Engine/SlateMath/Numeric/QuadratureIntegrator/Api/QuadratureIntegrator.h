/// 🧩 A Gauss–Legendre rule over the reference interval, derived once and reused.
/// note  🔴 The abscissae are **derived**, never transcribed. A transcribed set is accurate to the digits
///        somebody typed, and the same three defects `ColourProjection` met apply here: a sign, a place, and a
///        normalisation, each individually plausible. Newton on the Legendre recurrence has one place to be
///        wrong and converges to the last representable bit from the standard initial estimate.
/// note  🔴 The rule is derived **once** and integrated against many times. Deriving it per integral would make
///        `28`'s three surface builds pay a root-finding solve at every one of a million cells, and would make
///        the abscissae a cost rather than a constant.
/// note  📐 Declared Bounded, per `02` §5. The guarantee is over the **accumulation**, not over the rule's
///        agreement with the true integral: given the abscissa magnitudes the weighted sum is accumulated in
///        ordinal order and is therefore the same number on every machine and every run — `02` §5's ordered
///        recombination. How well the rule approximates the integrand is fixed by the abscissa count the caller
///        declares, and is the caller's declaration rather than this component's promise.
