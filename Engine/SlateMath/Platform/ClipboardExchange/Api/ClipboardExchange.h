///        statement about its alpha, and a premultiplied supply read as unpremultiplied darkens every partly
///        transparent texel — which reads as the imagery being wrong rather than as the convention being unsaid.
/// note  📝 Eight bits per component because that is what all three host clipboards carry. A wider source is
///        narrowed by whoever supplies it; nothing here widens a narrow one back and calls it precision.

///        nothing depends on a clipboard surviving — the artist copies something else a second later, and a
///        source holding a reference into the host clipboard would then describe content nobody supplied.
/// note  ⚠️ Text crosses as UTF-8 in both directions. Two of the three hosts carry wide text natively, so the
///        narrowing happens here rather than at each caller: a caller that narrowed it itself would narrow it
///        through the process code page, which silently drops every character outside it.
