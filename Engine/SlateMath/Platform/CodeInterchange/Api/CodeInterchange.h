// 📝 🔴 Everything between this banner and the next crosses to code compiled by a toolchain that is not this
//    build's. `04` §5 licenses the flat apparatus **here and nowhere else** — the five Slate units are static
//    libraries produced by one invocation with identical switches, and a marshalling layer between them solves a
//    problem that does not exist. `00` §2.1 states it; this file is the only place the licence is taken up.
// 🔴 No standard-library type appears in any declaration below. A `std::string` or a `std::vector` crossing here
//    would be laid out by whichever standard library the foreign code was built against, and two layouts of one
//    name is the failure mode that presents as arbitrary content rather than as a refusal.
