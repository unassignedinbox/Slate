// 📐 Every sample in the engine is placed by projecting a **sample ordinal** into a domain, and never by drawing
//    from a source of randomness. `02` §6 requires the device and the host to place samples identically, and
//    `54` §1 states the same rule one layer up for a different reason: a sampled source is not reproducible, so
//    the same document reopens looking different and a tile re-resolved at a finer level disagrees with the
//    coarse one it replaced.
//
// 🔴 The projection is in two halves and they carry **different guarantees**, which is stated here rather than
//    discovered by whoever first measures a disagreement. The ordinal-to-unit-square half is Exact: it is a bit
//    reversal and an integer ratio, and both toolchains produce the same bits. The unit-square-to-direction half
//    is Bounded: it reads a square root and a pair of circular functions, and no two toolchains agree on those
//    to the last place. A file that claimed one guarantee for both would be claiming the weaker one is stronger.

// 📝 Twenty digits of base three cover every ordinal below 3²⁰, and 3²⁰ is exactly representable, so the ratio
//    below is one correctly-rounded division rather than an accumulation of twenty of them.
