// 📐 The classifier answers containment by accumulating, over every edge of a closed polyline, both the winding
//    number and the crossing count — the first for the non-zero rule, the second for even-odd. Each edge's
//    contribution is decided by the **sign** of an orientation determinant, which is why the whole classification
//    inherits ClassifyOrientation's exactness rather than declaring an exactness of its own.
//
// 🔴 Exact over the polyline it is given, and the polyline is produced once. `CurveSolver`'s flattening is
//    Bounded, so flattening on the host and again on the device would give two polylines that agree to a
//    tolerance and disagree in their last bit — and an exact predicate over two different inputs is exact about
//    the wrong thing. `52` §4's parity requirement is met by classifying one shared polyline on both sides.
