// 📐 🔴 `66` §3: the scene carries radiance without an upper bound — `18` §2's emissive channels are unbounded —
//    and the display has one. The projection compresses that range and is required to be **monotonic**: a
//    brighter radiance is never a darker display code, or the artist can brighten a highlight and watch it darken.
//
// 🔴 The projection is **not invertible in general**, which is why `36` §6 samples a colour from the workspace
//    scene-referred, before this. No correction applied afterwards recovers what the compression discarded.
