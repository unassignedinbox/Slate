// 🧩 Which component of the packed word one illuminant occupies, the comparison that decides occlusion, and the upsample `18` reads it through.

// 📐 🔴 `60` §3.1 packs one visibility per illuminant per pixel into one RGBA8 word, **by `OcclusionIndex`
//    position**, and `18` unpacks by that same position. The position rule therefore crosses the toolchain seam
//    in both directions and is declared once here — the identical argument `AtmosphereProjection.slang.h` makes
//    for its three surface parameterisations. Two implementations of one position rule are two that will
//    eventually disagree about which slot an illuminant occupies, and the artist meets that as one light casting
//    another light's shadow.
//
// ⚠️ The packed capacity is `DirectOcclusionCapacity` and the reaching set is `44` §5's, which is wider. The
//    excess is integrated **unattenuated** and reported — `60` §3.1. Dropping the excess instead makes an
//    over-lit region go dark, which reads as a defect; leaving it unshadowed reads as missing shadow, which is
//    what it is.

// 📝 No slot; never a valid component ordinal. Declared as a constant rather than as an enumeration for the
//    reason `OcclusionUniform.slang` gives: an enumeration declared on the host has no spelling the shader
//    toolchain shares without a second declaration that must be kept identical.
