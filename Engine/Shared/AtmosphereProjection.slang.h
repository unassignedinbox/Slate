// 📐 🔴 A bake and the lookup that reads it are the same mapping written twice, and that is the defect this file
//    exists to make impossible. A transmittance surface baked through one arrangement of its axes and sampled
//    through another is not wrong by a visible amount — it is wrong by half a texel, which reaches the artist as
//    a horizon that sits slightly askew at one altitude and nowhere else, and which no reader attributes to a
//    parameterisation. `28` §2's three surfaces are built on the host and sampled on the device, so the mapping
//    crosses the toolchain seam in both directions and is declared here rather than in either.
//
// ⚠️ Lengths are **metres** throughout, and coefficients reciprocal metres, so every exponent is dimensionless
//    without a conversion. The donor formulation these mappings come from marches in kilometres and carries a
//    factor of a thousand at each exponentiation; that factor is absent here by construction, and it is the first
//    thing to look for if an atmosphere ported from that formulation comes out either opaque or absent.
