// 📐 🔴 Every routine below is read by `18`'s shading dispatch on the device and by `82`'s host preview of the
//    same surface — `82` §5 resolves a preview on the host and `00` §11 gates the agreement at Tier B. Where the
//    two disagree the artist blames the preview, because the preview is the thing that looks provisional, and
//    the defect is then attributed to the wrong subsystem for as long as it takes somebody to check.
//
// ⚠️ Nothing here is a shading model. `42` selects a `ReflectanceSelection` and `18` §3 declares which channels
//    each one consumes; what is declared here are the **terms** those selections compose from, so a selection is
//    a composition of these and never a second implementation of one of them.
//
// 🔴 Every term below is a **magnitude** and carries no colour. `36` §1 requires a colour to travel with the
//    space it is a coordinate in, and a term that returned three coordinates would be returning a colour in no
//    space at all. The caller applies each term per component and keeps the space it already holds.
