// 📐 🔴 `30` §1 is the load-bearing rule of that document, and it is here rather than at the resolve site so
//    that the composition cannot be written twice. `18` already added a specular ambient term from `28`, so a
//    reflection simply added on top lights the same surface twice; the resolve therefore **subtracts what `18`
//    contributed and swaps in what the trace found**.
//
// 🔴 Every failure resolves to a weight of nothing, at which point the subtraction and the addition cancel and
//    the pixel keeps exactly `18`'s ambient specular. That is the property that lets the trace be aggressive
//    about giving up: failure is free and invisible, so there is no fallback path to write and none to test.
