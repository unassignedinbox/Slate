// 🧩 Sign of a planar orientation determinant — filtered fast path over an exact expansion fallback.

#pragma once

#include "Shared/Prelude.slang.h"
#include "Contract/ToleranceContract.h"

// 📐 The predicate answers: walking Alpha → Beta → Gamma, does the path turn left, turn right, or stay
//    collinear. The quantity is the determinant
//
//        | Alphaₓ − Gammaₓ   Alpha_y − Gamma_y |
//        | Betaₓ  − Gammaₓ   Beta_y  − Gamma_y |
//
//    and only its **sign** is contracted. A predicate that is usually exact provides no topological
//    guarantee at all, so the filtered path is taken only where its own error bound excludes zero.

// 📝 An expansion is a sequence of non-overlapping terms held in increasing magnitude whose exact sum is
//    the quantity represented. Eight exact products contribute two terms each; the accumulation never
//    exceeds sixteen occupied terms and the declared capacity carries margin over that.
