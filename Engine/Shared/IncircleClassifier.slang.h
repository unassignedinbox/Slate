// 📐 The predicate answers: is Delta inside, on, or outside the circle through Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Taking
//    every position relative to Delta and lifting each onto the paraboloid, the quantity is
//
//        | αₓ−δₓ   α_y−δ_y   ‖α−δ‖² |
//        | βₓ−δₓ   β_y−δ_y   ‖β−δ‖² |
//        | γₓ−δₓ   γ_y−δ_y   ‖γ−δ‖² |
//
//    and only its **sign** is contracted. The sign is positive for a Delta inside the circle when Alpha, Beta
//    and Gamma wind counter-clockwise, and negates with their winding — which is why every consumer classifies
//    the winding first rather than assuming it.
//
// 📐 Expanded along the third column the determinant is a sum of three products, each of a two-term lift against
//    a two-by-two determinant. Both factors are short exact expansions, so the whole quantity is the accumulated
//    pairwise product of the two — degree four in the inputs, and never evaluated in floating point on this path.

// 💾 Three lifted products contribute at most thirty-two terms each, so ninety-six terms is the worst the arena
//    can hold. The declared extent carries margin over that. On a device this is a kibibyte of scratch per lane,
//    which is the reason `68` solves its unwrap on the host through `34` and the reason the filter below decides
//    every well-conditioned input before the arena is ever touched.
