// 🧩 Interval containment over the gapped labels `12` issues — one comparison, asked per occupant per rotation.

#pragma once

#include "Shared/Prelude.slang.h"

// 📐 `12` §2.1 answers "is A enclosed by B, at any depth" by comparing two interval labels rather than by walking
//    a relation, and `12` §3 compresses every subset into runs of ordinals for the same reason. Both reduce to
//    the three comparisons below, and both are asked by `16` and `26` **per occupant per rotation**, on the
//    device, against the same labels the host issued.
//
// 🔴 That is why the predicate is here rather than inside `SceneStructure`. A containment test written twice —
//    once for the outliner and once for the shading dispatch — is two tests that must agree about strictness at
//    every boundary, and the rotation on which they stop agreeing is the one where a selection outlines the
//    wrong enclosure while the shading outlines the right one.
