// 📐 🔴 `62` §3 collects transmissive fragments into `TransmissionIndex` with atomic sorted insertion on the
//    device, and `82` resolves the same column on the host for a preview. Both orderings are therefore this
//    file's, once: two implementations of one comparison are two that will eventually disagree about which of
//    two coplanar panes is in front, and the artist meets that as the two swapping as they orbit.
//
// 🔴 The ordering is **Exact**. `62` §7 declares the depth comparison Tier A even though depth itself is Tier B,
//    because what is required is not an exact depth but a **stable order** — an order that resolves by arrival
//    flickers, and it flickers most on exactly the coplanar surfaces artists build deliberately.

// 📝 No fragment; never a valid packed surface word. The partition field of a written word is always below
//    `PartitionCeiling`, so the all-ones word cannot collide with one.
#define SlateTransmissionAbsent (0xFFFFFFFFu)

// 📝 Triangle ordinals count **within** a partition — `16` §4 — and `Contract/`'s `PartitionTriangleCeiling` is
//    128, so seven bits carry every one of them. The partition ordinal takes the remaining twenty-five, which is
//    above `42`'s own partition ceiling of 2²⁰ with five bits of headroom.
