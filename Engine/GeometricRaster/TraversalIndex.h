// 🧩 R3 — Tier A software acceleration structure: tinybvh binned-SAH build → 8-wide compressed BVH (CWBVH, Ylitie 2017)
//    over the resident scene's world-space triangles. The GPU kernel traverses the two blobs this produces
//    (Shaders/TraversalCWBVH.slang, a 1:1 port of tinybvh kernels/traverse_cwbvh.cl).
//
//    Blob layout (both arrays of float4, 16 B "blocks"):
//        Nodes      80 B per node = 5 blocks: [p.xyz | e.xyz,imask] [childBase | triBase | meta 0-3 | meta 4-7]
//                   [qlo.x 0-7] [qlo.y 0-3, qhi.x] ... (Ylitie §4.2, exactly as tinybvh emits them)
//        Triangles  48 B per triangle = 3 blocks: e1 = v2 − v0, e2 = v1 − v0, v0 (w = primitive index bits)
//
//    Primitive index = flat triangle index into SceneStructure::QueryFlatTriangles() (which the kernel already
//    binds as `Triangles[]` for material / normal lookup), so a hit resolves with one extra fetch.
//
//    Coordinates: world space, RH +Z up, metres (CLAUDE.md §7) — tinybvh is axis-agnostic; nothing is swapped.
//    SIMD: the build uses whatever tinybvh detects at compile time (AVX2 on the toolchain's /arch:AVX2; scalar
//    fallback otherwise). Build is CPU-side, once per scene load (R8 moves dynamic geometry to GPU H-PLOC).

    //    rigid-body case — bodies translate and rotate but never change shape or triangle count.

    //    scene rather than with the moving part: 0.94 ms at 2 k triangles, 7.46 ms at 16.8 k. That is the honest
    //    ceiling of this approach and the reason a true two-level split (static BLAS emitted once, dynamic BLAS
    //    re-emitted alone) is the next optimisation rather than something already delivered here.

    //    BINARY tree (see the note on TraceClosestObjectSpace — the packed CWBVH walker is AVX-only and was
