// 📝 A construct declaring no depth target. Spelled rather than reached for through `SharedTarget::TargetCount`,

//    comes to believe it is one.

/// 🧩 One render construct, as the recording that draws through it declares it.
/// note  🔴 The colour order **is** the fragment's output order. A shader writing its second output to what
///       this run lists third writes it to another target entirely, and both targets then carry plausible
///       imagery — which is the reason the run is declared rather than derived from the produced set, whose
///       order is the contributing document's convenience.
/// note  ⚠️ `DepthTarget` carries `DepthTargetAbsent` for a construct that resolves no depth. It is the
///       ordinal of a `SharedTarget` otherwise, and `RelationOfTarget` is not consulted here — every target a
///       construct spans stands at the display extent by declaration.

/// 🧩 Every render construct the engine declares, and the span each one covers the claimed targets with.
/// note  🔴 `06` §2.1 settles **classic render construct, not dynamic**. Every graphics program in Slate is
///       constructed against a construct declared here, and a recording reaching for a dynamic rendering
///       declaration instead has taken a decision `06` already took.
/// note  🔴 Every attachment is declared to stand in the attachment layout on entry **and** on exit, so the
///       vendor performs no implicit transition. `ImageSpace::Transition` stays the one place a layout
///       changes — a construct that transitioned on its own would leave `ImageSpace`'s record naming a layout
///       the image is not in, and the next barrier would then be issued from the wrong one.
/// note  ⚠️ The constructs outlive an extent change and the spans do not. `06` §7 reclaims and re-claims every
///       display-relative target on a resize, which invalidates every view a span was derived over; the
///       construct describes formats alone and is untouched. `Derive` is what re-covers them.
