/// 🧩 The one optional vendor capability `06` negotiates by name — the driver's own diagnostic text, and the
///    per-object naming that makes that text nameable.
/// note  🔴 This is `SKILL-Naming`'s narrow reading of `Extension`: a queried, enabled and **owned** optional
///        vendor capability. `VulkanExchange::ConstructInstance` requests the extension and the validation
///        layer; nothing there holds what the request produced, and this holds it.
/// note  🔴 Compiled in every configuration rather than behind `SLATE_DEBUG`. A component compiled out of
///        Release is one whose every call site is conditional, and `06` §1's note on the capability set applies
///        verbatim — those conditionals never all leave. `Construct` refuses instead when nothing negotiated it,
///        and `Declare` delivers as a no-op, so no call site branches on the configuration.
/// note  ⚠️ Attached **after** `ConstructInstance` and **before** `ConstructDevice`. The capability is
///        instance-level, and a sink attached after the device exists cannot report what device creation itself
///        rejected — which is the one message worth having on a machine where bring-up refuses.
