// 🧩 The combined editor — every workspace subject in one host, with every device concern held by HostLifecycle.
//
// 🔴 LAYOUT RULE, READ BEFORE EDITING THIS HOST. The editor's layout is:
//      workspace windows (WorkspacePanel + WorkspaceIndex + the vendor dock)
//        → splittable panels (EditorPanel + PanelStructure: viewport | UV |
//          outliner | properties leaves, each with chrome and a footer)
//          → leaf content (SceneDirectoryPanel: the sky in a viewport leaf,
//            the outliner | details column in an outliner leaf, the
//            properties / camera-bookmark pages in a properties leaf).
//    The retired validation-shell prototype once duplicated the options rail,
//    texture-texture stack, parametric directory, and inspector. Runtime UI belongs
//    only to the standing panels named above; the editor's sky lives in the
//    viewport LEAF.
