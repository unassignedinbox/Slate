///        what "resolution-free source" means and the reason `20` §4 may evict what this produces.
/// note  🔴 The **whole** sequence is resolved, painted entries included. `20` §2.1 lists three reconstruction
///        sources and a mixed sequence needs all three composed; a resolver that skipped painted entries would
///        hand `20` a partial tile it has no route to complete. `PromotionScheduler::Estimate` already charges

/// note  🔴 Every source resolves identically here and on the device — `00` §11 gates the agreement at Tier B
///        through `ParityRunner`. Where the two disagree the artist blames the preview, because the preview is
///        the thing that looks provisional, and the defect is then attributed to the wrong subsystem for as long

/// note  ⚠️ 🚧 Imagery is **refused** rather than sampled. `50` retains a decoded image's original bytes and
///        performs `36` §3's conversion into the working space nowhere, so sampling here would return values in a
///        content-native space nothing declared. Refusing is the honest state of the tree; converting per sample
