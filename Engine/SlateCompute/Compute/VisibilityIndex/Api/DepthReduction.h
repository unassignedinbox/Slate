//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// 📐 🔴 Depth is reversed — `NearPlaneDepth` is one and `FarPlaneDepth` is zero. The conservative reduction over a
//    reversed target is therefore the **minimum**: the least ordinate across a region is its furthest point, and a
//    partition whose nearest ordinate is below it cannot reach past anything already recorded there.
// ⚠️ Reducing by maximum instead is the one defect this arrangement invites. It produces a reduction that is
//    correct wherever the surface is flat and rejects visible geometry at every silhouette, which the artist meets
//    as an object flickering along its own edge rather than as a comparison written the wrong way round.

// 📝 Levels a reduction may carry. The finest level is the display extent and each further level halves both
//    ordinates, so the ceiling is reached only above `DisplayExtentCeiling` — 2¹⁴ needs fifteen levels including
//    the finest, and one more is headroom rather than a budget anything is expected to spend.

///        resolves to. The ordinates live on the device and nowhere else.
/// note  🔴 The reduction tested in phase ① is the **previous** rotation's, and the one tested in phase ③ is this
///        rotation's, reduced from what phase ② rasterised. `16` §2 requires both, and a single-phase test
