///        and does not belong here, and `Declare` refuses one outright rather than admitting it and hoping
///        nothing evicts it.
/// note  🔴 The decision is read from `56` §3 and never made here — `SourceReconstructible` is that document's
///        function and this calls it. `20` never decides what may be discarded; it reads the decision the
///        document already made, because a residency system classifying content itself would be classifying
///        content it can only see as texels.
/// note  ⚠️ `Cache` is banned and the substitution is not a euphemism. A cache is a copy of something that
///        exists elsewhere; a depot is a store of artefacts that exist nowhere else and are cheaper to rebuild
///        than to keep. `24` §3's transferred result is the second kind, which is why it may be evicted at all.
