/// 🧩 What the outline is drawn as — its extent in display pixels, and the two renderings occlusion selects between.
/// note  🔴 `26` §4: the width is declared in **display pixels** and never in domain or world units. A width that
///        scales with distance makes a selected occupant lose its outline as the artist backs away from it, which
///        reads as the selection having been dropped.
/// note  🔴 `26` §2: the occluded rendering is visually distinct and **not merely dimmer**. The distinctness is
///        carried by the dash extent as well as by the colour, so a document authored against a display where the
///        two colours read alike still shows which part of the selection stands behind something.
/// note  🔴 Both colours are `ColourSpecification` values in the display space. The recording is display-referred
///        and is never tone-mapped, so a colour arriving working-referred would be presented uncompressed — and
///        `36` §1's rule that no bare triple exists anywhere is what makes that discoverable rather than silent.
