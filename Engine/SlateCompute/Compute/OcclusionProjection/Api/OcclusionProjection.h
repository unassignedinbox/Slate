//    when the camera moves, so the body reads `46` while the block does not declare it. Two closures were
//    available and neither is free: deriving a reversed-depth projection locally would be `46` §3's derivation
//    written a second time, which is `00` §2's case and the exact shape of the defect `Contract/`'s two depth
//    constants exist to prevent. The edge is therefore declared and read, and the omission is recorded as an
