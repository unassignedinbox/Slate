//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// 📐 Texels per edge of one accumulation tile, at **every** reduction level. The working extent at level L is
//    `MaximumWorkingEdge >> L` and the cell count is `VirtualCellsPerEdge >> L`, so their ratio is invariant and
//    equals `PhysicalTileTexels`. Deriving it per level would be deriving a constant.
inline constexpr std::uint32_t CoverageTileTexels = MaximumWorkingEdge / VirtualCellsPerEdge;   // [px] - 128

// 📝 🔴 No apron. `20` §1's apron exists so a **filtered** read near a tile edge finds valid neighbours; this
//    extent is written and read at exact texels and is filtered by nothing. An impression spanning two cells
//    writes into each cell's own tile, and every texel belongs to exactly one cell by construction.

// 💾 One tile is 128² floats — 64 KiB. Tiles are claimed as cells are touched, so an ordinary stroke costs a
//    handful; the ceiling below is every cell of the finest level, which is the most a stroke can touch at all.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// 🧩 The coverage one stroke has accumulated, held sparsely by cell and reclaimed whole.
/// note  🔴 `22` §3: a stroke resolves into an accumulation extent **first** and applies once to the surface.
///        Applying per impression lets overlapping impressions within one stroke double-darken at their
///        intersections, which is visible wherever an artist slows down — and slowing down is what an artist
///        does at exactly the places they care about.
/// note  📐 Accumulation is `Over`, whatever combination the brush declares. `CombineCoverage(Over, a, b)` is
///        `a + b(1 − a)`, which is symmetric in its two operands — so the accumulated coverage does not depend
///        on the order the impressions were resolved in. That is what lets `22` §2's deferred impression resolve
///        two rotations later without disturbing the ones around it.
/// note  🔴 This holds coverage and **no channel value**. `58` §2 declares one shape and a value per channel, so
///        the values are constants of the stroke and only the coverage varies per texel. Holding values here
///        would be holding one number per channel per texel to store the same number everywhere.
