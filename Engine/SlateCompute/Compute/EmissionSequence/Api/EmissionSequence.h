// 🔴 The widest edge an emission may declare. Sixteen thousand per edge at four components is a gigabyte in
//    single precision, which is the point past which an export is a decision the artist should have been asked
//    about rather than a wait they are subjected to. Refused at Open, where the refusal costs nothing.

// 📝 Rows one band resolves. `50` §5 runs an emission through `34` at `Background`, and a work item that
//    resolved a whole image would occupy a worker for the length of the export and starve nothing visibly while
//    doing it — right up until the artist closes the document. A band is the unit that can be abandoned.
