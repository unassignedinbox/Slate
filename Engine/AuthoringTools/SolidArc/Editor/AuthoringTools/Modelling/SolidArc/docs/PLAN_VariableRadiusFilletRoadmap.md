# Variable-radius fillet roadmap — bounded implementation plan

The requested follow-on work is broad. It will be delivered as individually verified slices;
no slice will be described as completing the whole variable-radius or healing roadmap.

## Stage 1 — rolling-ball variable-radius application on one straight planar corner

Accept one finite, straight, two-plane corner with a positive **linear** radius law along the
edge. At every edge station, the meridian is an exact quarter-circle rolling-ball section. The
result is reconstructed as five ruled/lofted side surfaces plus two planar end caps, with the
analytic volume checked against the integrated rounded-corner area.

Boundaries for this stage:

- complete finite straight edge only;
- two perpendicular planar supports;
- positive linear law and positive remaining corner width;
- no partial-edge selection, nonlinear law, G2 requirement, freeform support, or healing of an
  arbitrary input B-rep;
- input selection/console dispatch is a later slice if the explicit reconstruction is sound.

## Stage 2 — variable setback laws ✅

`VariableSetbackCornerSpecification` adds a separate positive linear law for support
setback/clearance on the same bounded straight planar corner. At each station the measured
support extent is `d(t) = r(t) + s(t)`, and the verifier checks that identity at multiple
stations, the analytic volume, topology, normals, refusals, and a distinct comparison render.
The route is intentionally one common setback law for the two perpendicular supports; unequal
support setbacks, nonlinear laws, and general input-edge selection remain outside the stage.
See `docs/PLAN_VariableSetbackLaw.md`.

## Stage 3a — quadratic nonlinear radius law ✅

`QuadraticRadiusLaw` and `QuadraticVariableRadiusSurface` add an explicit nonlinear radius
interpolant through endpoint and middle-station values. A quadratic loft through three exact
quarter-circle sections reconstructs one bounded straight planar corner, with analytic volume
and sampled circumferential/meridional curvature acceptance. See
`docs/PLAN_NonlinearRadiusLaw.md`.

## Stage 3b — bounded G2 continuity profile ✅

`G2PlanarCornerSpecification` adds a separate quintic non-rolling corner profile with
support-aligned tangents and zero endpoint curvature. The profile is extruded and its endpoint
curvature is measured against both planar supports. This proves the G2 construction boundary,
not G2 for the circular rolling-ball or nonlinear-radius routes. See
`docs/PLAN_G2PlanarCorner.md`.

## Stage 3c — nonlinear setback laws ✅

`NonlinearVariableSetbackCornerSpecification` adds a genuinely nonlinear quadratic support-setback
law while the radius may remain constant or linear. Three exact station sections are quadratic-
lofted, with analytic extent/removal volume and positivity/refusal checks. See
`docs/PLAN_NonlinearSetbackLaw.md`.

## Stage 3c.1 — unequal support-setback laws ✅

`UnequalSetbackCornerSpecification` adds independent positive linear clearance laws to the two
perpendicular supports. Equal laws refuse to keep this route distinct from the common-setback
construction; the product-of-extents volume and asymmetric topology are verified. See
`docs/PLAN_UnequalSetbackLaw.md`.

## Stage 3d — rolling-ball G2 continuity

Still open. Replace the circular/rolling support join with a construction whose tangent and
curvature match are measured on both sides, without describing the Stage 3b quintic profile as
a rolling-ball solution.

## Stage 3e — nonlinear unequal support-setback laws

A bounded two-support nonlinear extension is complete: `NonlinearUnequalSetbackCornerSpecification`
requires one positive quadratic radius law and two independent positive, genuinely nonlinear
quadratic clearance laws. Three exact stations drive five quadratic lofts with a shared station
parameterization so the asymmetric longitudinal seams remain watertight. The analytic volume is
the integral of the product of the two quadratic extents minus the integrated quarter-circle
removal. `V10/E15/C30/L7/F7` topology, normals, positivity, linear/equal-law refusals, and the
comparison proof are covered by `NonlinearUnequalSetbackCornerVerification`. This does not
approximate rolling-ball G2, general edge selection, freeform supports, or healing. See
`docs/PLAN_NonlinearUnequalSetbackLaw.md`.

## Stage 4 — partial edges, apexes, broader supports, curved loops, and healing

Each is a separate classifier/reconstruction slice:

- partial-edge blends with exact endpoint caps — **Stage 4a bounded slice complete**;
- complete and partial apex fillets — **Stage 4b bounded coaxial cone route complete**;
- non-coaxial/oblique/mixed-support routes;
- arbitrary curved edge loops and corner patches;
- general intersection/trim/sew healing only after explicit topology ownership exists.

Stage 4a is intentionally only `PartialEdgeFilletSpecification`: one straight orthogonal corner,
constant positive radius, and strict interior interval. See `docs/PLAN_PartialEdgeBlend.md`.
Variable-radius partial edges, arbitrary input-edge selection beyond the named bounded routes,
mixed/non-coaxial apex fillets, freeform supports, and general healing remain open. Stage 4b is
documented in `docs/PLAN_ConeApexFillet.md`.

## Stage 4c — quadratic-radius partial edge

A bounded nonlinear extension of Stage 4a is complete: `QuadraticPartialEdgeFilletSpecification`
accepts one genuinely quadratic positive law over one strict interior interval, but does not
claim arbitrary variable-radius support handling or rolling-ball G2. See
`docs/PLAN_QuadraticPartialEdgeBlend.md`.

## Stage 4d — partial coaxial conical-apex spherical fillet

A second bounded apex route is complete: `PartialConeApexFilletSpecification` accepts one right
circular cone, one exact spherical apex cap below the tangent-circle fit limit, one strict
non-reflex sweep, one partial base sector, and two explicit planar meridian Coons caps. The
canonical half-turn proves `V6/E9/F5/L5` topology, genus-zero closure, outward normals, and the
analytic frustum-plus-spherical-cap sector volume. Zero/full/negative sweeps, consuming radii,
and degenerate dimensions refuse transactionally. Arbitrary apex selection, mixed or non-coaxial
supports, rolling-ball G2, freeform geometry, and general healing remain unsupported. See
`docs/PLAN_PartialConeApexFillet.md`.

## Stage 4e — oblique planar corner fillet

A bounded broader-support route is complete: `ObliquePlanarCornerFilletSpecification` accepts
one explicit finite straight edge frame, two planar support directions, one strict interior wedge
angle, finite support extents, and one positive constant radius. Exact tangent distance
`r cot(theta/2)`, a rational circular extrusion, retained outer support, and two end caps produce
`V8/E12/F6/L6`; the analytic wedge-minus-circular-segment volume, normals, and refusal boundaries
are covered by `ObliquePlanarCornerFilletVerification`. Variable laws, partial edges, arbitrary
edge selection, apexes, freeform supports, and healing remain unsupported. See
`docs/PLAN_ObliquePlanarCornerFillet.md`.

## Stage 5 — proof coverage ✅

The nine older Phase 25/26/31/32/32z baseline verifiers now run in the focused gate and persist
their original distinct PNG names. This is durable proof coverage only; it does not add a new
geometry capability or relabel any existing fixture. See `docs/PLAN_BaselineProofArtifacts.md`
and `docs/PROOF_AUDIT_2026-09-22.md`.

## Immediate exit gate

Stage 1 needs a production API, a dedicated verifier, transactional refusals, analytic volume
and topology checks, an exterior-facing filled proof image, and a full focused gate with zero
failures. The verifier must also prove that zero/negative/consuming laws and non-planar,
non-perpendicular, partial, nonlinear, and apex requests refuse.
