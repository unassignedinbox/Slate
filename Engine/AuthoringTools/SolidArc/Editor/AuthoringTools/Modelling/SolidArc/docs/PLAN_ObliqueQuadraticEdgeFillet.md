# Stage 4h — bounded oblique quadratic full-edge fillet

Extend the completed oblique quadratic partial-edge route to one complete finite straight edge.
The corner is rounded over the entire edge by one genuinely nonlinear positive quadratic radius
law; no sharp continuation or interval transition is introduced.

## Acceptance boundary

- one explicit finite straight edge with two planar support directions perpendicular to it;
- strict wedge angle `0 < theta < pi`;
- one genuinely nonlinear positive quadratic radius law over the complete edge;
- every tangent distance is exactly `r(t) cot(theta/2)` and remains below both finite support widths;
- rational quadratic lofts through start, middle, and end circular stations;
- exact retained support/outer surfaces, variable rational fillet band, and explicit finite end caps;
- analytic volume from integrating the oblique removed-corner area, proportional to the integrated
  quadratic radius square;
- closed genus-zero topology, outward-normal and station-fit checks, and transactional refusals;
- partial intervals, arbitrary variable-radius laws, arbitrary edge selection, non-planar/freeform
  supports, apexes, rolling-ball G2, and healing remain unsupported.
