// SolidArc · bounded general face editing

// The public face-edit surface is deliberately conservative. It accepts canonical axis-aligned
// rectangular prisms, bounded triangular-, pentagonal-, hexagonal-prism, concave-prism, circular-sector-prism, revolved-annular-prism,
// genus-one holed-prism, elliptical-prism, and oblique triangular-prism routes, bounded concave-prism
// offset/shell/draft and triangular-prism draft routes, a bounded twin-holed-prism route,
// and natural NURBS replacement faces whose rim is identical to the selected rim. Operations are copy-in/copy-out: a refusal never mutates the
// source. This is the safe foundation for extending the routes to arbitrary trimmed and curved B-reps later.
