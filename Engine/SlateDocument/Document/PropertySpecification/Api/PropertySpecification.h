/// 🧩 One property as its owner declared it — its name, its measure, its bounds, and its default.
/// note  🔴 `10` §2.2: validation is part of the declaration and not a separate step performed by whoever writes
///        the value. A property that can hold an invalid value between the write and the check has an invalid
///        state, and something will observe it.
/// note  🔴 `42` §2's rule holds here too: an absent value resolves to the **declared** default, which is not
///        assumed to be zero. A magnitude defaulted to zero produces a surface that is black or invisible, and
///        the artist reads that as a broken material rather than as a missing declaration.
/// note  📝 `76` §4 requires every tool parameter to be one of these, so that `ToolPanel` presents any tool
///        without knowing which. A tool presented by hand-written panel code is a tool the panel must be edited
///        to add.
