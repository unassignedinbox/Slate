///        unsupported construct still decodes; refusing the whole of it would lose the artist the ninety-nine
///        paths that were fine. The whole point of positioning a refusal is that the artist can go and look.

/// 🧩 Translates one vector stream into paths, refusing every construct outside `52` §2's subset by name.
/// in    Stream      [-]  the whole stream, as `StorageExchange` drained it
/// in    OriginPath  [-]  where it was read from; occupied on the file route only
/// out   Deliver     [-]  refuses with ContentUnsupported for a stream carrying no path at all
/// err   never throws
/// cost  🔴
/// note  🔴 `52` §2 converts strokes at **intake** and stores no width — and intake is above this line, not on
///        it. Converting one means flattening it first, and `52` §4's tolerance is resolution-relative, so a
///        codec that chose one would have fixed the resolution every later placement is resolved at. What is
///        translated here is the geometry; a stroked element is named in the refusals with its position, so the
///        artist is told rather than silently handed a filled path where they drew a line.
/// note  🔴 An open path stays open. Closing it silently changes which side of it the interior is on, and the
///        artist sees that as the fill having moved rather than as the path having been altered.
/// note  📝 The file route and the supplied-text route produce the identical specification — `52` §1 — so this
///        translation is the file route's half and nothing downstream can tell which route was taken.
