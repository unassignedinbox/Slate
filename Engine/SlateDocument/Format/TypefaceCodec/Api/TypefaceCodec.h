/// note  🔴 Outlines arrive in the typeface's own units and are not scaled to a pixel size here. A typeface

///        conversion between them happens at intake. Converting would put a tolerance into a translation, and
///        `52` §4's tolerance is resolution-relative and belongs to whoever flattens.
/// note  ⚠️ An empty glyph — a space, most often — decodes to a glyph carrying no path and is retained. Dropping
///        it would renumber every ordinal after it, and the glyph sequence `52` §3 stores indexes those ordinals.
