///                        declined, and with ExtentExhausted for a stream carrying no face at all
/// err   never throws; the vendored parser's allocation is released on every path out
/// cost  🔴
/// note  🔴 `50` §2 ① and `38`'s non-mutation rule: nothing is welded, rewound, triangulated or dropped. A run
///        of fewer than three corners is handed over as it arrived and refused by `TopologyStructure::DeclareFace`,
///        which is where that refusal is declared to happen. A codec that dropped it would have produced a
///        specification that no longer describes the file the artist supplied.
/// note  🔴 Perpendiculars survive only where the stream indexes them exactly as it indexes positions. Where a
///        corner carries a perpendicular its vertex does not, per-vertex storage can hold only one of the two —
///        so none is emitted and `per-corner surface perpendiculars` is named in `UnsupportedNamed`, where `86`
///        reports it. Averaging them would be a repair, and picking one would be a silent loss.
/// note  📝 Wavefront declares no unit convention, so `UnitScaleDeclared` is false and `50` §3 records the
///        assumption at intake. Materials referenced through an external library are not read — the codec
///        translates the stream it was handed — but each face still carries the enrollment its directives set.
