# SKILL-Naming — Engine Naming Generation (Authoritative, Strict)

Never recall names from memory. Construct every name strictly from physical or mathematical mechanism.

Synced to `DOC/Foundation/04-UnitDirectoryStructure.md` §0 and `DOC/Foundation/00-DirectoryStructure.md`
§1.1, which are the current authority. Where an older document disagrees, this file wins.

## Generation Procedure

① State the physical mechanism in one plain sentence (memory layout, geometric transform, numerical
process, spatial relation).
② Extract the technical verb and the target noun; fuse them into a compound identifier that describes
the mechanism and reality, not the category.
③ Modules and folders MUST follow the two-word PascalCase formula `<Subject><Role>` using the closed
Role suffix list below and nothing else.

If a candidate is rejected at any gate, restart from step ①.

## Closed Role Suffixes — Final, 19 Entries

| Suffix           | Technical meaning                                                      | Owns memory |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Sequence`       | Ordered workflow — strokes, layer order, revisions, poses               | Yes         |
| `Codec`          | Stream translation — image, vector, audio, binary                      | No          |
| `Exchange`       | Transfer across a system, vendor or hardware edge                      | Yes         |
| `Interchange`    | Standardised protocol or platform-abstracted translation               | Yes         |
| `Extension`      | A vendor-declared optional capability, negotiated and then held        | Yes         |
| `Solver`         | Equation systems — linear, constraint, unwrap, boolean                 | No          |
| `Integrator`     | Quadrature and accumulation — time stepping, coverage, moments         | No          |
| `Classifier`     | Geometric and statistical predicates                                    | No          |
| `Projection`     | Transform between spaces — geometric, spectral, colour                 | No          |
| `Specification`  | Parametric schema                                                       | Yes         |
| `Structure`      | Topology — B-rep, polyhedral, skeletal, sparse                         | Yes         |
| `Space`          | Spatial subdivision — tile, voxel, byte extent, recursive subdivision   | Yes         |
| `Index`          | Slot ledger — generational tokens, interning, spatial hashing          | Yes         |
| `Metrics`        | Diagnostic measurement — log sinks, markers, timing                    | Yes         |
| `Scheduler`      | Task and priority ordering                                              | Yes         |
| `Queue`          | Task execution — thread pools, command and event queues                | Yes         |
| `Panel`          | UI presentation — workspace, control, overlay                          | No          |
| `Host`           | Executable target entry point                                           | Yes         |
| `Depot`          | A store of derived, evictable, reconstructible artefacts keyed by content | Yes       |

`Extension` is narrow: it names a queried, enabled and owned optional vendor capability
(`DiagnosticExtension` holds `VK_EXT_debug_utils`). It is not a general spelling for "an edge" — use
`Exchange` for that.

## 🔴 Retired Suffixes — Never Use as a Role

`Boundary`, `Region`, and `Tree` are retired from the suffix list. `Boundary` named every category of edge
at once — OS, vendor, hardware, protocol — which made it the least informative suffix; it is replaced by
`Exchange` / `Interchange` / `Extension`, chosen by *what crosses*.

| Retired                      | Replacement                                                              |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Region` (allocation extent) | `Space` — a bounded storage extent that is sliced and reclaimed          |
| `Tree` (topology)            | `Structure` — for example `BoundingStructure`                            |
| `Tree` (recursive subdivision) | `Space` — for example `OctantSpace`, `AxisSpace`                       |
| `Boundary` (any edge)        | `Exchange` / `Interchange` / `Extension` per the table above             |

## Word Substitutions — Fixed Once, Mechanically

The addendum bans `Cadence`, `Binding`, `Submission`, `Footprint`, `Region`, `Tree`, `Vacancy`. It is
the later statement and it wins. Substitutions are fixed here rather than decided per module.

| Retired      | Replacement                | Mechanism the replacement states                      |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Vacancy…`   | `Occupancy…`               | States the occupied set; the free set is its complement |
| `Binding…`   | `Descriptor…`              | Names the Vulkan object actually held                  |
| `Submission…`| `Command…`                 | Names what is recorded, not the verb                   |
| `Cadence…`   | `Cycle…` / `Slot…`          | Completion-ordered reuse, or one reusable position                               |
| `Footprint…` | `Extent…` / `Slot…`        | Measured extent, or the slot it occupies               |

## Recording Cycle Vocabulary

The recording cycle uses the following closed spellings. `Rotation` remains reserved for actual angular or quaternion mechanisms.

| Spelling | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| `CycleScheduler` | Orders completion-gated reuse of recording slots |
| `CycleSlot` | Fence and semaphores ordering one reusable position |
| `RecordingSlotCount` | Number of reusable recording positions |
| `SlotIndex` | One position within that count |
| `RecordingNumber` | Monotonic recording number counted from bring-up |
| `PerSlot` | Content replicated once for every reusable position |
| `RecordedSlot` | Measurements retained for one reusable position |
| `TimestampsPerSlot` | Timestamp count claimed by each reusable position |
| `CompletedRecordings` | Number of recordings advanced since bring-up |

## Full Substitution Record

A search for a retired spelling must land here rather than returning nothing.

| Retired                    | Replacement              | Mechanism the replacement states                       |

## Fallible Return Vocabulary

These spellings are distinct mechanisms and never interchangeable generic return wrappers.

| Spelling              | Standing | Mechanism |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|
| `Deliver<Content>`    | Approved | One fallible call either delivers `Content` or carries a `Refusal`. This is the public spelling; `ContentDelivery<Content>` is its declaration and is never named outside `DeliveryGuarantee.h`. |
| `Response<Content>`   | Reserved | Content answering a previously declared request. It is not a general function return. |
| `Status<Content>`     | Reserved | A diagnostic reading observed at one declared instant. Its diagnostic subject must be stated before introduction. |
| `Expected<Content>`   | Reserved | Resource content anticipated from an asynchronous acquisition. Its pending, arrived and refused conditions must be specified before introduction. |
| `Resolution<Content>` | Reserved | Content produced by a declared resolution procedure. It applies only where `Resolve` is the actual technical operation. |

A reserved spelling records intent only. It must not enter C++ until its full mechanism, ownership and refusal behaviour are declared.

## Banned Words

Banned OO / AI tropes — Manager, Handler, Processor, Controller, Service, Utility, Helper, Node, Frame,
Module, Core, System, Backend, Pass, Stage, Harness, Shell, Entity, Element, Subsystem, Hierarchy, Data,
Info (use Information), Object, Item, Thing, Kind, Base, flag, state, value.

Banned grandiose branding words — Forge, Nexus, Apex, Hub, Studio, Suite, Engine (as a product name),
Vertex (as branding), Prime, Ultra, Pro, Max, Zenith, Pinnacle, Summit, Vanguard, Catalyst, Quantum,
Synergy, Fusion, Genesis, Odyssey, Horizon (as branding), Titan, Atlas (already barred structurally).

⚠️ These are the words a language model reaches for when it wants a name to sound impressive rather than to
say what the thing does. `Forge` tells a reader nothing: it does not say the tool authors a tyre, edits a
specification or generates a mesh — it only signals that something important supposedly happens inside.
Name the mechanism: a tool that generates a tyre is a `TyreGenerator`, the panel that draws it is a
`TyreGeneratorPanel`, the project seam that feeds it is a `TyreGeneratorSequence`.

⚠️ `Kind` is banned in prose as well as in identifiers, because it is the word that gets reached for when a
mechanism has not yet been named. State the discriminating mechanism instead: a recording declares a `Command`,
a decal declares its `Source`, a layer declares its `Content`. Neighbouring vague spellings — `Type`, `Sort`,
`Variety`, `Flavour`, `Category`, `Class` used as a noun — carry the same defect and are rejected with it.

Banned family / kinship terms (whole category barred) — Parent, Child, Sibling, Sister, Neighbor,
Ancestor, Descendant, Orphan.

Banned structural words — Table, Map, Block, Digest, Model, Handle, Store, Bridge, Atlas, Substrate,
Fabric, Cache, Evaluator, Evaluate, Journal, Resolver, Mesh, Pool, Registry, Catalog, Repository,
Directory, Vault, Arena, Inventory, Ledger, Plan, Filter, Grid, Array, Dispatcher, Memory, Buffer,
Pipeline, Flow, Composite, Compose, Composition, Allocation, Shell, Tier, Nesting, Stratum, Mip,
Messenger, Probe, Blend, History, Bake, Stamp, Contract, Outcome, Prelude.

⚠️ `Contract` and `Outcome` are banned for the same reason as `Handle` and `Store`: each names a
programming-language concept rather than a mechanism. A contract is what every declaration in this engine
already is, so the word distinguishes nothing; an outcome is what every call already returns. State what
crosses instead — a `Guarantee` is declared, and a `Deliver<Content>` either delivers or refuses.

| Retired      | Replacement            | Mechanism the replacement states                          |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `…Contract`  | `…Guarantee`           | What the declaration promises, in the caller's terms       |
| `Outcome<T>` | `Deliver<T>`           | Content delivered across one fallible call, or a refusal   |
| `Prelude`    | `ToolchainInterchange` | One source translated for the host and shader toolchains   |

⚠️ `Prelude` is banned for a reason distinct from the two above: it states only **where** a file sits —
first, ahead of the rest — which is true of every header and therefore distinguishes nothing. Positional
names are rejected on the same ground as categorical ones. Neighbouring spellings carry the same defect and
are rejected with it: `Preamble`, `Epilogue`, `Header`, `Common`, `Global`, `Misc`.

Banned addendum words — Cadence, Binding, Submission, Footprint, Region, Tree, Vacancy, Ordinates,
Ordinal, Test, Draft, Draught, Paint.

⚠️ `Draft` and `Draught` are banned as **imprecise state words**, not as spellings of each other. Both mean
"provisional" — a thing that is not finished yet — which describes the moment a mechanism is observed rather
than the mechanism. Every placement in progress is provisional; saying so distinguishes nothing, exactly as
`state` and `Kind` distinguish nothing. State what is being placed and how far it has got: a `SketchTool`
takes anchors until its `PlacementMethod` is satisfied, and then it seals.

⚠️ `Paint` is banned because it names the artist's gesture, not the mechanism that carries it. The engine
writes texels into a layer of a texture through an impression; whether the artist thinks of that as
painting, stencilling, stamping or masking is presentation. `Texture` names the content and `Texturing` the
discipline — and `SymbolDiscipline` already spells it that way, so the vocabulary exists.

| Retired         | Replacement                        | Mechanism the replacement states                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Draft…`        | `SketchTool…` / `…Placement`       | A tool taking anchors, and how far it has got          |
| `DraftSubject`  | `SketchSubject`                    | Which shape is being placed                            |
| `Paint…`        | `Texture…` / `Texturing…`          | Texels written into a layer, and the discipline        |
| `PaintStroke`   | `TextureStroke`                    | One continuous impression across a surface             |

🔴 `Modelling` is **already** unavailable and this is not a new ban: `Model` is a banned structural word and
the ban has no carve-out for the participle, which `SymbolSpecification.h:18` records. The polygonal
discipline is `Geometry`; the constrained-2D discipline is `Sketch`. A `ModellingToolset` cannot be spelled,
so the units are `SketchToolset` and `TextureToolset`.

`Ordinates` is banned because it means a mathematical coordinate, not a general UI state or UI configuration. Use
`Configuration` for user and panel configuration, `Context` for live interaction data, `LayoutProfile` for shared
layout inputs, and `TypographyMetrics` for measured text. Examples: `ControlCentreConfiguration`,
`LayerStackContext`, `ThemeProfile`, `LayoutProfile`, `TypographyProfile`, and `TypographyMetrics`.

`Ordinal` is banned too (project directive). Like `Prelude` it states only *where* something sits in an abstract
sequence — first, second, nth — which distinguishes nothing about the mechanism. State the mechanism instead: a
countable position is a `Slot` or an `Index`, a monotonic counter is a `Number`, an ordered workflow is a
`Sequence`. So `SlotOrdinal` → `SlotIndex`, `RecordingOrdinal` → `RecordingNumber`, `ImageOrdinal` → `ImageIndex`.

`Test` is banned (project directive). It names the *activity* of trying something, not the mechanism that carries it
— every routine that runs is, in that loose sense, a trial of something, so the word distinguishes nothing. State
what the code actually does and to what standard:

| Retired         | Replacement                        | Mechanism the replacement states                       |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `…Tests`        | `…Checks` / `…Verification`        | Invariants asserted against a subsystem                |
| `RunTests`      | `RunChecks`                        | The verification suite executes                        |
| `TestTrack`     | `ProvingGround`                    | The circuit a vehicle is exercised on                  |
| `TestDrive`     | `TrialDrive`                       | One driven trial of the vehicle                        |

The rendered-artefact discipline is already `VisualProof` and scene checks are already `…Validation`; unit and
integration suites are `…Checks`. `Trial` (as in `InterfaceTrial`, `TrialDrive`) and `ProvingGround` are the
domain nouns for a driven attempt and the place it happens, and neither carries the banned word.

## Mathematical Vocabulary Exemption

A term is permitted anywhere — folder, file, type, function — when it names a *defined mathematical or
physical object* rather than a software category. A graph is the pair (V, E). A predicate is a function
into {true, false}. A quadrature is an approximation of a definite integral. Banning these does not
raise precision, it lowers it, because the replacement is always vaguer than the term it displaces.

Exempted under this clause — `Graph`, `Predicate`, `Quadrature`, `Interpolant`, `Field`, `Kernel` (the
convolution or integration kernel, never "the OS kernel"), `Partition` (domain decomposition), `Region`,
`Space`, `Tree`, `Simplex`, `Intrinsic`.

⚠️ The exemption is **narrow**. It licenses the term only where the mathematical object is genuinely what
is meant. `NodeGraph` is exempt; `SceneGraph` meaning "the scene manager" is not. `Predicate` in
`OrientationPredicate` is exempt; `PredicateHandler` is not. `Region` and `Tree` remain retired as *role
suffixes* regardless of this exemption — the exemption covers mathematical usage, not module naming.

`Simplex` and `Intrinsic` are approved under this clause and are **not yet used anywhere in the engine**.
They are recorded here so that the mechanism each one denotes is fixed before the first use, rather than
argued about at it.

| Approved    | The mechanism it names                                                        | What it does **not** license                              |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Simplex`   | The convex hull of *n*+1 affinely independent points — point, segment, triangle, tetrahedron. The unit of a simplicial complex, of barycentric coordinates, and of Delaunay and GJK reasoning. | "Simple", "the simplest case", or a triangle that is only ever a rendering triangle — that is a `Facet` of a `Structure`. |
| `Intrinsic` | A quantity determined by a body itself, independent of how it is embedded or observed — Gaussian curvature, geodesic distance, the first fundamental form; and, at the machine edge, a compiler-supplied operation standing for one hardware instruction. | An adjective for "built in", "inherent", or "internal". Those state no mechanism, and `Intrinsic` used that way is the same defect as `Kind`. |

⚠️ `Intrinsic` carries two exact meanings — differential-geometric and machine-level — and both are
admitted, because both name something measurable. The gate is that the surrounding name must make clear
which: `IntrinsicCurvature` is the surface, `InstructionIntrinsic` the machine. A bare `Intrinsic`
qualifying nothing is rejected.

Named individual exemptions — `UvSurfaceDepot` keeps `Surface`; `SpatialReach` keeps `Reach`.

## Formatting Rules

- ALL internal identifiers (folders, files, classes, variables, functions) use PascalCase.
- Zero shorthand — full words only: Parameter not Param, Windowing not Wsi, Allocation not Alloc,
  Specification not Spec, Information not Info.
- Zero single-letter names. Zero `k` constant prefixes — use `MinimumBoundary`, `ToleranceThreshold`.

## Identifier Rules

- Variables: never mirror the class type as the variable name. Forbidden `TopologyCluster
  TopologyCluster`; required `ActiveTopologyCluster` or `PrimaryTopologyCluster`.
- Instance suffixes: Instance, Entry, Slot.
- Booleans: never prefix with `is` / `has` / `can`. State the property directly as a noun phrase —
  `BoundaryCondition`, `ClosedEnabled`, `VisibilityEnabled`.
- Functions: PascalCase domain-specific technical verbs only — Solve, Integrate, Traverse, Construct,
  Resolve, Reclaim, Linearize, Classify, Project. CRUD and vague verbs are strictly banned — Get, Set,
  Process, Handle, Manage, Commit, Compose, Draw, Update, Evaluate.

## Variable Register

Sibling spellings reserved for *identifiers* — locals, members and parameters — so that a module name and
the things inside it do not collide. These are never folder names.

| Module         | Reserved identifier spellings                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `RequestQueue` | `RequestQueue`, `ReturnIndex`, `PageQueue`     |
| `BrickSpace`   | `SparseSpace`, `VoxelSpace`, `CellSpace`       |

`ReturnIndex` names the readback half specifically; `PageQueue` names the drained arrival order.
`SparseSpace` is the occupancy hierarchy, `VoxelSpace` the sampled lattice, `CellSpace` one brick's
interior subdivision.

## Gates

- Reject generic categories, framework jargon, and power words (Apex, Nexus).
- Subject uniqueness: a Subject word appears at most once within a given layer.
- Third-party API exemption: direct Vulkan / SDK calls mirror the vendor API verbatim (for example
  `VkDeviceCreateInfo`). All internal engine code enforces the full internal naming rules.

Purpose — every identifier and module folder must document its exact spatial, mathematical, or
structural mechanism.
