// 📦 Exhibits/Workbench/Drive/XPBDSubstepInvariance.cpp — the proof that the soft tyre is XPBD and not PBD
//============================================================================================================================================
//
//    THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST.  Macklin et al. introduced XPBD precisely so that a constraint's stiffness stops
//    depending on how the solver is scheduled.  In plain PBD a constraint is projected all the way to C = 0 each
//    iteration, so more iterations (or more substeps) means a stiffer material: the same tyre under the same load
//    settles to a different deflection whenever the timestep budget changes.  XPBD fixes this by carrying a
//    Lagrange multiplier and a compliance α̃ = α/Δτ², which together pin the constraint to a real stiffness 1/α
//    that the schedule cannot move.
//
//    So the honest test of "did we actually implement XPBD" is not that the tyre looks squashy. It is:
//
//        load the same tyre with the same force, solve it at 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 substeps,
//        and require the settled deflection to agree.
//
//    This test FAILED BY CONSTRUCTION before the rewrite, because the solver dropped λ and the −α̃λ term and so
//    was PBD wearing a compliance-shaped denominator. It is kept as the regression gate for that defect.
//
//    Build: see RunDriveMirror.py / the Project-Drive Makefile. Standalone, no GPU.
