# Headless visual proof for the development editor — compiles the patched vendor plus Engine/Editor, drives ten
#    ticks through the engine's tick order, rasterises the last tick with a dependency-free CPU rasteriser, and
#    gates the PNG: three occupied columns, a trapezoid slant on both tab edges, titled strips, the seated theme
#    tints, and the four faces the theme seats. Then the interaction phases drive the pointer the way the
#    engine does — the category menu opens, a Camera pick narrows the outline, the palette opens over the
#    console, the views menu poses the orbit, the gizmo answers — and each phase rasterises its own sheet.
