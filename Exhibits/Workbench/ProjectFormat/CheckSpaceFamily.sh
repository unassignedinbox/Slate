# P1–P6 gate — the Space container family: one header, one directory, thirteen file types, and the two lossless tools.
#
#    usage: bash Exhibits/Workbench/ProjectFormat/CheckSpaceFamily.sh [-v]
#
# What runs, in order:
#    · SpaceFamilyProof — the format's own eight claims (Docs/ProjectFormat.md §8), on this machine: lossless round trip
#      for every type, resident records out and back by memcmp, dedup flat in N, references resolving and failing by name,
#      unknown tables skipped and a flipped bit named, the CLI parsing both spellings, the 49-material census, and the
#      Copied/Shared/CoW equivalence. Two of the eight are image comparisons and report SKIPPED with their CPU half
#      stated — this machine has no device, and the gate says so instead of quietly passing them.
#    · SpaceTool — the same claims through the COMMAND LINE (P4): export the M10 level as a project, re-read it with
#      -Verify (every vertex, index, cluster and material compared against the level builder), print the container with
#      -Info, then Pack it with the content directory deleted and Explode it back.
#    · the shell-level round trips the plan names: two exports byte-identical, Pack(Explode(X)) == X, and the P6 vocabulary
#      present in one export.
#
# ⚠️ Everything it writes goes under Build/Space (gitignored): the gate measures the format, it does not commit artefacts.
