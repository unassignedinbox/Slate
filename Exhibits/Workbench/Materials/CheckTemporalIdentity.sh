# D10 — temporal integration for MOVING GEOMETRY: does the reuse follow the object, and does it stop following the
#       wrong one?
#
#    The kernel reprojects every history read (the running mean in ResolveSurface, and both reservoir pools) through the
#    R2 motion vectors and validates it on the surface's normal and depth. That rule is necessary and it is not enough:
#    an object that slides across a coplanar neighbour, or two objects that exchange places, present the SAME normal and
#    the SAME depth at the reprojected pixel — so the pixel inherits radiance that was shaded for something else, and
#    the running mean carries it until the sample count drowns it. D10 adds the third fact a history has to remember:
#    WHICH surface it came from (kFeatureTemporalIdentity, bit 9).
#
#    This gate measures the two halves of that claim, on the CPU mirror of the kernel (MaterialLevelViewport, which is
#    the kernel's own estimator with the same constants), because neither can be measured off a still frame:
#
#      ① THE SHADOW FOLLOWS THE OBJECT. The moving object's shadow is tested against the renderer's own intersector: a grid of
#         floor points, each shot sun-ward, and the subset whose first blocker is the moving object IS its shadow. Both
#         poses must cast one and the two footprints must differ — the direction-agnostic statement of "the shadow moved
#         with it". (The mirror re-poses the geometry AND rebuilds the acceleration structure, so the shadow rays see the
#         object where it actually is: a moving object with a lagging shadow is the other half of this acceptance.)
#
#      ② THE GHOST IS REFUSED, AND IT SHOWS. The driver slides one swatch along its own plane, out and back, so the
#         closing frame's scene is the REST scene — which makes a plain render of the untouched level a ground truth
#         for it. ⚠️ That ground truth deliberately SHARES the arm's seed stream: this is a PAIRED comparison, where the
#         two arms differ in one switch and the Monte-Carlo noise is common to both, so the difference that survives is
#         the ghost and not the sampling. (Roadmap #7's `--seed-stream` is the opposite tool for a different question —
#         the absolute distance from a converged reference, where shared noise would flatter the estimate. Use it here
#         and the pair gets noisier without becoming more honest; the claim above is about a difference, not a level.) The same sequence then runs twice, once with identity validation and once without
#         (--restir-no-identity, the pre-D10 rule), and the error against that ground truth is compared. Measured on the
#         M10 row-3 crop / 256x192 / 4 spp / 16 frames: 891 vs 1732 RMSE (0.0136 vs 0.0264 normalised), i.e. the ghosts
#         the identity refuses are about twice the error the pre-D10 rule leaves in the picture.
#
#      ③ A STILL SCENE IS NOT DISTURBED. The identity is the OBJECT, not the triangle: a per-frame sub-pixel jitter over
#         a 1500-triangle sphere reports a different triangle almost every frame, and an identity that fine restarted
#         13.5 % of a STATIC image for nothing (measured — it was the first cut, and this check is why it was replaced).
#         So the A/B is also run with no motion at all: the two arms must agree to within a couple of percent of pixels,
#         and the refused-read count must stay at the level of genuine silhouettes.
#
#    The shader side of the contract (bit 9, the identity in the moment image, and the compact reservoir record whose
#    final std430 word is a native uint identity) is checked by Tools/Build/CheckShaders.sh and by the matching host
#    static assertion; this gate checks the behaviour.
#    Usage: CheckTemporalIdentity.sh [fast]
