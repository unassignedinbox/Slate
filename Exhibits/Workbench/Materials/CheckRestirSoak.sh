# Roadmap #2 — the 1 000-frame soak: is reservoir growth BOUNDED, and does a bounded M stop helping?
#
#    The ticket was opened when the spatial pass fed its own output back into the temporal history and M compounded —
#    mean 843 633 by frame 20: an unbounded reservoir, which makes the reuse meaningless (every merge is dominated by
#    whatever the previous frame decided, so the estimator stops responding to the scene). The fix took the TEMPORAL
#    reservoir into the history and capped each tap against the receiver's PRE-merge count. What was never run is the
#    long soak that says the fixed form is still bounded at 1 000 frames rather than at the 128 the sheets use.
#
#    This gate is that run, and the arithmetic read at the end:
#
#      ① the run completes with the harness's own zero-non-finite assertion intact, at every checkpoint;
#      ② no ceiling warning — the mirror prints one the moment max M passes 1e8, which is the uint32 ceiling the shader
#         stores M in (`GpuReservoir.Counts.x`). A saturation here is a wrap, and a wrapped M is a reservoir whose
#         confidence is nonsense;
#      ③ M does not COMPOUND: between checkpoints, mean M may not grow faster than the frame count does. Linear growth
#         is what a bounded merge does (each frame adds at most 20x the current count); super-linear growth is the
#         failure this ticket exists for. The measured shape is not even linear — M SATURATES (mean ~60 from frame 25
#         on, max 84 at every checkpoint, still 58.9 at frame 1 000) — so the assertion has room either way;
#      ④ the clamp bounds the ERROR too, not just M. This is measured against an INDEPENDENT reference (a 512-spp render
#         on `--seed-stream 1`, roadmap #7), because an error-versus-shared-reference curve is not monotone in the run
#         length and would measure the correlation rather than the estimator: measured on the shared stream, the plain
#         arm's error RISES 389.79 → 511.76 between 250 and 1 000 frames (it decouples from the reference's own noise),
#         while on the independent stream it falls 734.05 → 627.62. ④ therefore has TWO forms, because the claim differs
#         with the run length and asserting one form for both was a bug in this gate's first cut (the `fast` mode failed
#         on a 12 % move that is a *true* statement about the arm, not a defect):
#           · full (1 000 frames, compared 250 → 1 000): the arm is past its plateau, so a ±10 % band is the assertion —
#             that is the "the clamp is also the floor" claim;
#           · fast (250 frames, compared 62 → 250): the arm is still closing on the plateau (~-12 % over that span), so
#             the assertion is monotone improvement, and the plateau band is what the full run exists to measure.
#         Both forms PRINT both references' numbers rather than hiding the difference;
#      ⑤ the plain arm at the same budget is a control: it must improve over its span (a quarter of ④'s), or ④'s statement
#         would be a blind metric rather than a clamped reservoir. Measured in full: 1 017.76 → 734.05 (−28 %) from 62
#         to 250 frames.
#
#    What the numbers say (2026-09-18, 128×72): M is bounded, and so is the error — the ReSTIR arm's distance to a
#    converged reference is FLAT from about frame 250 on (7 334.1 → 7 423.8 independent, band 6 918–7 636 over the run).
#    The clamp is therefore both the fix and the floor: with M saturating near 60, the temporal filter's effective
#    memory is ~M frames, and additional frames resample the same clamped weights instead of adding information.
#    Buying accuracy past this point takes taps/candidates/coverage (report §14.3's dial matrix), not more frames.
#
#    Usage: CheckRestirSoak.sh [fast]      (fast = 250 frames, ~3 min; full = 1 000, ~6 min)
