"""Rasterise the REAL editor — `Engine/Editor/EditorHost` driven through the engine's own tick order.

`Exhibits/Workbench/Editor/EditorProof.cpp` is the engine's own headless editor proof: it builds the patched
vendor ImGui the application ships, drives EditorHost's tick order, walks the pointer through the category menu,
a selection, the palette, the views menu and the gizmo, and rasterises the resulting `ImDrawData` for each phase.
The viewport inside those sheets is the engine's CPU ReSTIR trace, not a picture of one.

Nothing about the editor is drawn by this script.  It compiles the engine's proof and copies out what it wrote.

The engine's own `CheckEditorProof.sh` link line has rotted: `InspectorPanel.cpp` gained nine
`Record*Inspector` translation units and the ThorVG-backed `IconPresentation`, and the script was never updated,
so it dies at link before a single sheet is written.  The corrected list below is the fix — the additions are the
engine's own files, nothing is substituted.
