# Project-Zero integration: GPU transplant + showcase scene (default)

> NOTE (union merge): the `PZIntegration/000*.patch` files this page
> once told you to apply are **already applied in this tree** — the
> live `Engine/`, `Source/`, shaders and build files below ARE the
> post-patch state, and the patch files themselves were removed to
> keep the codebase clean. The "Apply" section is kept for the
> historical record only; if you hold this tree, skip straight to
> "Build and run".

Opening the Project-Zero executable renders the showcase: a soil plain
scattered with one hundred analytical shapes (boxes, spheres, cones,
cylinders, pyramids, tetrahedra, wedges — near and far, one unique
material + colour each), under a sunset sky with full moon, stars,
broken cirrus, and marching ground mist — plus camera lens flare,
halo, and an anamorphic streak, all enabled by default. Everything is
lit strictly by ReSTIR DI + ReSTIR GI in `.slang`, nothing else; the
flare is a post-process camera artifact, not a light.

The product renderer is the `arena/01a08d16-frontier` Vulkan + Slang
stack, transplanted verbatim: sun/sky/light/ReSTIR all run on the GPU
through the branch's existing shaders. The CPU path tracer in this
patch is only the no-GPU sandbox stand-in — it renders the same
showcase scene for verification, nothing more.

## Apply (engine checkout)

From a fresh checkout of `SultanAladin/Frontier-` at engine `main`
(shallow `f17fb6f`, 2026-09-14 — the same base the delta was generated
and apply-checked against), with the `streamlinkinbox/Frontier`
`arena/01a08d16-frontier` branch fetched. Two commands:

```sh
git checkout arena/01a08d16-frontier -- Engine EngineContent Scripts Patches imgui.ini Projects/Project-Dyno Projects/Project-Zero
git apply PZIntegration/0002-project-zero-gpu-transplant.patch   # this file ships here
git apply PZIntegration/0003-project-zero-moon-textures.patch    # moon texture generator + moon dimming
```

The checkout is byte-identical by construction (git does the copying,
so the transplanted engine is verbatim). The delta is 21 files /
~4250 lines: the showcase solver additions, the scene/camera/sunset
wiring, the CPU reference, and the explicit build lists. It keeps the
transplanted `ToolchainSequence.ps1` untouched (zero changes — every
file it compiles stays on its branch path).

## Build and run

Product — Windows MSVC + Vulkan SDK + Slang (double-click build):

```bat
Projects\Project-Zero\Construct.bat            :: builds the Vulkan .exe, opens the live window
Projects\Project-Zero\Construct.bat -Rebuild -Run
```

`Construct.bat` forwards to `Build/ToolchainSequence.ps1` (arguments
pass through: `-Configuration Debug|Release`, `-Rebuild`, `-Run`).
First build fetches the submodules/packages the script lists
(`imgui` on `docking`, GLFW, Jolt, cgltf, stb, …) — that step needs
network; afterwards the build is offline. The window opens on the
showcase at sunset with the sun-only flare in frame; fly with
`WASD` + mouse (Unreal-style fly-through), `ESC` quits. `--scene
cornell|outdoor|shaderball|showroom|drop` (or a `.gltf` path) selects
the other levels; the default is `showcase`.

CPU reference — headless, no GPU needed (sandbox stand-in):

```sh
cd Projects/Project-Zero && make
./bin/Project-Zero-CpuReference                                   # combined Showcase + authored 5x4 grid, 1280x720
./bin/Project-Zero-CpuReference --sun 18.3 --yaw 0 --pitch 2      # moonlit night + stars + moon
./bin/Project-Zero-CpuReference --flarevar 1                      # anamorphic streak variety
./bin/Project-Zero-CpuReference --no-denoise --no-reprojection    # M9 raw A/B leg
```

Windows: `Build/Construct.ps1 [-Run]` builds
`bin\Project-Zero-CpuReference.exe` with `cl.exe` (`/std:c++20 /O2
/W4`, explicit 7-file list — it never globs `Source/`, where the
Vulkan entry point lives). CMake: `cmake --build build --config
Release --target Project-Zero-CpuReference`.

Flags: `--sun H`, `--yaw D` `--pitch D` (default `220 -20`, facing the
sunset), `--fog clear|morning|backlit`, `--width W` `--height H`,
`--bounce N` (default 8), `--passes N` (default 2), `--flare 0|1`,
`--flarevar 0|1|2|3` (cinematic/anamorphic/starburst/halo), `--no-denoise`,
`--no-reprojection`. Output lands in `./Diagnostics/`:
`ProjectZero_Showcase.ppm` always, plus
`.png` when Python is found. The PPM is byte-identical run to run
(`5f2b610d…e31` default, `d81cf940…03e` anamorphic, `78d6096b…2dd`
night, after the 0003 moon dimming; determinism verified by repeat
runs and by a pristine-tree fresh-apply rebuild producing the same
hash).

## What the delta contains

- `Source/RayTracingSolver.h/.cpp`: the branch solver plus
  `ConstructShowcaseScene` (deterministic `mt19937(2026)` field, 101
  per-object spans), the Z-up showcase primitives (`AppendBoxUp`,
  fixed-tessellation sphere/cone/cylinder/pyramid/tetra/wedge —
  arity-distinct overloads, the branch's `Append` behaviour is
  untouched), and a median-split BVH behind a fast path that only the
  showcase triggers (Cornell/Outdoor never build one, so their
  brute-force path is byte-for-byte the branch's).
- `Source/GameExecution.cpp`: `--scene showcase` alias, the
  export-once regen block (mirrors the Outdoor block:
  `ConstructShowcaseScene` → `BuildTriangleIndex` /
  `BuildMaterialDescriptors` → `SceneCodec::Encode` with
  `Name = "Showcase"` + spans, so each object becomes a named glTF
  node), the `Showcase` camera branch (`0, -14, 2.2`, yaw 220°,
  pitch −2° — the CPU proof framing), and the default level changed
  from CornellBox to Showcase (the Cornell box stays one `--scene`
  path away, untouched as the reference).
- `Source/CelestialSequence.cpp`: one line — the staged local hour
  moves from `15.5f` (mid-afternoon) to `17.93f` (sunset). Moon,
  speed, and every other celestial default stay branch-verbatim.
- `Source/CpuReferenceMain.cpp` (new): the headless CPU entry point —
  the v2 main with the windowed mode removed (no window, no worker
  thread, one frame then exit).
- `Source/RendererHost.*`, `Source/SkyFogIntegrator.*`,
  `Shaders/*`: the CPU path tracer, repointed at the Engine math
  (`TracingIndex.h`, `Engine/GeometricRaster/CameraProjection.h`,
  `Engine/DeviceExchange/OrientationClassifier.h`) with a mechanical
  `RayRecord` → `RayStructure` rename (identical layout). No
  algorithm changed.
- `Engine/DeviceExchange/TriangleSpan.h` (new) + one-line includes in
  `SwapchainExchange.h`, `TracingIndex.h`, `SceneCodec.h`: the
  4-field `TriangleSpanRecord` moves out of the Vulkan-requiring
  `SwapchainExchange.h` so the CPU reference can parse the solver
  header. Same struct, same namespace, visible everywhere it was —
  the GPU build is unaffected (this also fixes `SceneCodec.h`'s
  latent include-order dependency on the record).
- `Construct.bat`, `Build/Construct.ps1`, `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`:
  the `.bat` forwards to `ToolchainSequence.ps1`; the other three
  become explicit 7-file CPU lists (`Project-Zero-CpuReference`).
- `Source/FlyThroughSolver.*`, `ToolchainSequence.ps1`, and every
  other transplanted file: branch-verbatim, zero delta.

## Architecture (unchanged from v2 unless noted)

- `Source/SkyFogIntegrator` owns the single showcase atmosphere. It
  compiles the shipped `.slang` core as C++ in one translation unit
  (no ODR risk: the header never names `.slang` types) and exposes
  sun/moon direction + radiance, sky radiance, the fog march, aerial
  perspective, and the panel post chain. The solar ephemeris and the
  panel defaults are verbatim copies of the gated harness sources,
  cited in-file; the showcase staging (sun hour 17.93, azimuth −60°,
  moon in the northern sky, broken cirrus, boosted stars) only stages
  the mirror algorithm's inputs, never its code.
- Frame convention: the engine world is Z-up, the render core is Y-up
  (panel frame). `RenderFromWorld` / `WorldFromRender` rotate between
  them. All sky/fog math runs in the render frame; only ray endpoints
  and light vectors cross the boundary.
- `RenderShowcaseFrame` keeps the six-phase structure: visibility,
  direct sun *and moon* illumination with shadow segment tests (both
  directional, no new sampler types), ReSTIR GI candidates (bounce
  misses contribute sky ambient), spatial reuse with Jacobian shift
  (clamped ≤ 10, M-cap 20×), the bilateral filter, then composition:
  surface + aerial perspective, fog march along the primary ray, sky
  for misses.
- Phase 7 applies the panel `post` lens flare mirror in linear HDR
  before the post chain. `FlareSpecification.slang` transcribes the
  reference `lensFlare` term by term (8-slot chromatic ghosts, the
  chromatic halo ring, the blue streak, starburst spikes, the hot
  core, `FlareVariety` weights 0 cinematic / 1 anamorphic /
  2 starburst / 3 halo) with the panel's own defaults (ghosts 5,
  halo 0.55, streak 0.8, chroma 0.65). Flare is sun-only, like the
  panel: the moon and stars never carry flare, and night frames are
  flare-free. `--flarevar` selects the variety (default 0).

## Moon textures (0003)

`Tools/GenerateMoonTextures.py` (stdlib-only, seeded, deterministic —
byte-identical on any Python 3) generates equirectangular albedo maps
for the 22 major moons: Luna, Phobos, Deimos, Io, Europa, Ganymede,
Callisto, Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Iapetus,
Hyperion, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, Miranda, Triton, Charon.
Every other known moon is a tiny rock; they can share generic
variants if ever needed. Run once from the engine root:

```sh
python Tools/GenerateMoonTextures.py
# -> EngineContent/CelestialTextures/Moons/<name>_<res>.ppm (22 files)
```

PPM (P6) loads directly via `stb_image` on the GPU side and is already
git-ignored (`*.ppm`), so generated textures never dirty the tree.
Each moon has a hand-tuned recipe (Luna's maria + rayed craters, Io's
volcanoes + Pele ring, Europa's lineae, Titan's haze bands, Iapetus'
dichotomy, Enceladus' tiger stripes, Triton's cantaloupe + wind
streaks, Charon's Mordor pole, …). Proof: `PZIntegration/moons_contact.jpg`.
Wiring the textures into the renderers (GPU atlas slots, CPU sampling,
which moons hang in the showcase sky) is the next step after this patch.

File manifest (sha256 of the generated files — re-running the script
must reproduce these exactly):

```
8d2610bd…c524920  ariel_1k.ppm       5c5d35aa…1241e2  callisto_1k.ppm
5543ecd8…386a8fc  charon_1k.ppm       22faddc6…10136  deimos_1k.ppm

c86f3686…fd5c     triton_1k.ppm       d8242904…db3a    umbriel_1k.ppm
```

0003 also dims the showcase moon (disc `moonBright` 3.0 → 1.2,
moonlight ×0.45) — the night proof below is the after.

## Verification record (sandbox, g++ 12, no GPU)

- Include audit: all 321 quoted `#include`s across the transplanted
  tree resolve — 310 relative to the including file, 11 via the
  script's `-I` flags (`imgui.h` and backends, `DisplayPresentation`
  via `-I Engine`, the Dyno pair via `-I Project-Dyno/Source`).
- CPU reference: clean build under `-std=c++20 -O2 -Wall -Wextra`
  (zero warnings) via `make`, via a direct `g++` line, and via a
  pristine-tree fresh-apply rebuild — all produce sha256
  `5f2b610d…e31` for the default 640×480 frame, and repeat runs are
  byte-identical. C++17 and C++20 builds agree.
- 0003: pristine tree → transplant → 0002 → 0003 applies cleanly,
  rebuilds warning-free, and reproduces the dimmed `5f2b610d…e31`
  hash; the generator runs from `Tools/` and lands all 22 textures
  in `EngineContent/CelestialTextures/Moons/` with the manifest
  hashes above.
- Export-path signatures checked against the branch headers:
  `BuildTriangleIndex` / `BuildMaterialDescriptors` take `const
  RayTracingSolver&`, `SceneEncodeConfiguration` carries `Name` +
  `Spans` — the showcase regen block matches exactly, and spans
  decode to one named glTF node per object.
- v2 → v3 baseline shift, quantified: the Engine math swap moves
  last-ulp ray rounding, visible only where the image has
  near-discontinuities (the streak core): 99.847% of bytes identical,
  max abs diff 73 LSB on a single streak-core pixel, 41 of 307200
  pixels differ by more than 2 LSB. Scene, camera, sky, and flare
  are otherwise pixel-identical (view-verified).
- GPU build: not runnable in this sandbox (no Vulkan SDK / GPU), but
  every GPU translation unit is branch-verbatim except the five
  additive showcase edits and the two behaviour-neutral span-record
  moves, all reviewed line by line; braces/parens balance and the
  export-call arity were machine-checked.
- Proofs: `PZIntegration/showcase_{sunset,night,anamorphic}.png`
  (default sun-facing view, moon night view, anamorphic variety).

## Notes and limits

- The `.slang` files compile as C++ through the prelude for the CPU
  stand-in (their Slang validity is untouched); the GPU build
  compiles the branch's own shader sources with `slangc`.
- The moon, clouds, and star boost are showcase staging with no
  panel source (new features, default-off in the mirror gates).
  Placement/density are artist tuning, not physics errors.
- History: `0001-project-zero-showcase.patch` (commit `39443ad`,
  CPU-windowed era) is superseded by the transplant + `0002` and
  kept for the record; apply only ONE of them (`0001` onto bare
  `f17fb6f`, `0002` onto `f17fb6f` + transplant). `0003` stacks on
  top of `0002` (moon textures + dimming).

## Union merge: editor tree + 07b renderer (this branch)

The `arena/01a0a4e7-frontier` editor commits apply directly onto this
branch (`6800ed2`, `dcd5926` — tree-identical to that tip), and the
07b-line renderer work is merged back over them (`5591d5b`):
showcase default, sunset staging, 0005 cloud shadows, moon generator,
full CPU reference. The editor is then re-seated on the showcase
(`3003480`): roster cap 64 → 256, Cloud Shadows + Shadow Clock cards
on the Cloud Layer sheet, level name in the outliner head, proof
harness tracing the showcase. Nothing below changes how you build;
this section only records what moved.

- CPU reference hashes (authoritative, 640x480, `--sun 10.5`):
  FIN3 `8688374c…ada4`, OFF `260aa1f6…ce85f`, OVC `3b488241…f7f553`
  (see `Diagnostics/Proof/0005_HASHES.txt` — reproduced bit-exact on
  the merged tree). The pre-0005 sunset default `5f2b610d…` is stale:
  FIN3 changed the default weather, the merged default renders
  `f185dddc…` (same flags, `./bin/Project-Zero-CpuReference` bare).
- Moon textures: `python3 Tools/GenerateMoonTextures.py` writes the
  deterministic 22-PPM set (~50 MB) to
  `EngineContent/CelestialTextures/Moons/` (git-ignored, regenerable,
  byte-identical across runs). The GPU atlas still seats the 6 stock
  moons; the 22-set is staged, unwired — a follow-up, not this merge.
- Gates: `RunCelestialParity.py` no longer hardcodes the author's
  `/home/user/Frontier` oracle path (repo-relative now). Full gate
  status on the merged tree: celestial PASS, fog PASS, editor proof
  PASS (showcase sheets), CPU reference PASS (hashes above).
- GPU build (your box): `Construct.bat` as before; the editor records
  in `-Development` builds (`FRONTIER_DEVELOPMENT`, on by default in
  `ToolchainSequence.ps1 -Development` and in the CMake Vulkan target).
