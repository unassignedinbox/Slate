# Project Zero — celestial sun + sky + fog in `.slang`, lit strictly by ReSTIR

The celestial panel's sun and atmosphere (Mie scattering, dawn/dusk/twilight,
sun disc + aureole, planet ground), implemented in Slang from the panel's own
algorithms, plus researched atmospheric + local volumetric fog — all lit by
ReSTIR direct + indirect, nothing else.

## Layout

- `Integration/Shaders/` — the shipped code: `SkySpecification.slang` (sky +
  sun), `FogSpecification.slang` (atmospheric + local fog),
  `ReSTIRSequence.slang` (reservoirs + the 9 compute entries),
  `SlangInterchange.h` (dual-compile header). See `Integration/Shaders/README.md`
  for the contract and the Vulkan integration guide.
- `INTEGRATION.md` + `PZIntegration/0001-project-zero-showcase.patch` —
  the Project Zero integration: the patch makes the engine open on the
  100-object showcase scene (sunset sky, moon, stars, clouds, ground
  mist through ReSTIR DI + GI; verified: builds warning-free, runs,
  deterministic, matches the harness sky within 3 LDR).
  `Integration/Build/` holds port/format tooling.
- `Host/` — CPU harness that compiles the shipped `.slang` verbatim as C++17:
  `SkyViewport` (reference frames), `CpuPortDiff` (second-truth frames),
  `ReSTIRConvergence` (T2/T3/T4), `MediaProbe` (media sampler for G3),
  `SunPosition.h` (host ephemeris), `SlangCompat.h` (dual-compile prelude),
  `CpuPort/` (vendored upstream transcription + provenance).
  `SkyViewport` takes `--media 0|1` (media ablation) and `--fov` (crops).
- `Diagnostics/` — `CheckCelestialSlang.py` (static contract rules),
  `RunCelestialParity.py` (the sky gate), `RunFogParity.py` (the fog gate),
  `CelestialParity.txt` / `FogParity.txt` (last reports), `Proof/` (proof
  renders + diff maps).

## Build and run the gates

```sh
cd Host && make            # SkyViewport CpuPortDiff MediaProbe ReSTIRConvergence
cd ../Diagnostics && python3 RunCelestialParity.py   # everything (about 100 s)
```

`RunCelestialParity.py` renders the 10-frame matrix (line window, ignition,
dawn/day/sun-disc, night), checks it against the oracle (G1) and the upstream
port media-free (G2), verifies the media against numpy over 36 000 seeded rows
(G3), runs the static rules, and runs the ReSTIR convergence proof. Exit code
0 iff all green;
`--skip-restir` skips the slow part. Requirements: `g++` (C++17), `python3`
with PIL + numpy. No GPU, no Vulkan SDK, no Slang toolchain needed for any
gate — the one thing this sandbox cannot do is compile the Slang-only shell
(see `Integration/Shaders/README.md`, last section).

## Results (last full run)

- Parity: 10/10 frames vs the oracle at max 1 LSB full-frame (ground and
  sun disc included); 10/10 vs the upstream port media-free at max 2 LSB on
  the sky mask (1 star-edge pixel); media 36 000/36 000 rows vs numpy.
- ReSTIR: DI/GI estimates match independent brute-force references at all 3
  probes (floor, floor-left, wall); determinism bit-exact.
- Fog: F1 density vs numpy worst 0.001 of tolerance, F2 march vs numpy worst
  0.806 (both over 2000 seeded rows; the march now covers the global
  height-fog span, not just local volumes); F3 determinism
  byte-identical; proofs `Diagnostics/Proof/fog_{clear,morning,backlit}.png`,
  report `Diagnostics/FogParity.txt`.
  Research: `Reviews/Fog-Research-2026-09-14.md`.
- Integration: the engine patch (`PZIntegration/`) builds warning-free and
  opens Project Zero on the 100-object showcase (sunset + moon + mist,
  sun-only lens flare/halo/streak, `--sun 18.3` for a starry night);
  sky matches the harness within 3 LDR, runs are byte-identical.

## Material channel grid

Run `Project-Zero.exe --scene materialgrid` to generate and load `Content/Scenes/MaterialGrid.gltf`. The export-once exhibit presents 20 unique material descriptors in a 5 × 4 grid: plastic, bone, clearcoat, glossy/clear glass, gold/silver/copper/iron/brushed metals, cloth, wax, jade, thin film, emissive, and unlit. It uses the normal glTF interchange path, so the renderer and material inspector see the same records as authored content. See `../../Docs/MaterialGrid.md` for the channel map and remaining validation work.
