// 🧩 Project-Zero's trial interface — the P0 spike, and the project half of the engine/project seam (CLAUDE.md §6).
//    The engine draws rounded rectangles, arcs, needles and segment cells; THIS file decides that six of them make a
//    small control panel, where they sit, and what values they show. Nothing here is reusable and nothing here is
//    meant to be: the real product builds its own composition against the same engine.
//
// The trial deliberately stays small — a housing, two buttons, a toggle, a progress bar, one arc meter with a spring
//    needle, and a two-digit readout. Enough to prove the chain end to end (retained graph → one draw → springs),
//    not a cockpit. Gauges proper, glyph text, input and transitions arrive in P1–P5.
//
// Layout is the VERB here: ConstructTrialLayout places the parts, exactly as ConstructControlLayout does in the 2D
//    overlay. It is not the name of a drawable.
