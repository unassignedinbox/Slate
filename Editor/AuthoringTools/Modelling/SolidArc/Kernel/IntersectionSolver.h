// 📦 Editor/EditorTools/ParametricSketcher/Kernel/IntersectionSolver.h — surface–surface intersection (SSI) and B-rep booleans
//============================================================================================================================================
// Two solids meet along curves that lie on both boundaries. The solver finds them on the true NURBS surfaces:
//    1. seed   — coarse tessellations of the trimmed faces are intersected triangle against triangle; the segments are
//                chained per face pair into polylines that carry (u,v) on both faces,
//    2. refine — every chain point is pulled onto both surfaces by tangent-plane Newton iteration; points where a chain
//                leaves a face are solved as edge-curve ∩ surface so both neighbouring faces agree to KernelTolerance,
//    3. densify — chords are subdivided (again refined) until the interpolating cubic follows the true curve,
//    4. split  — every face becomes a planar arrangement in its own (u,v) domain: trimming loops (edges split at exits)
//                plus cut curves; the arrangement's cells are the face pieces,
//    5. classify — a piece touching a cut curve is inside the other body iff its inward direction across the curve points
//                against the other face's normal (exact, local); the rest follow by flooding across shared edges, and
//                untouched hulls by a parity ray against the other body,
//    6. assemble — union / subtract / intersect choose pieces (subtraction flips the tool's) and share edges and vertices
//                so the result is again a closed, consistently wound B-rep with (u,v) trims on every coedge.
//    General free-form intersections must be transversal. Exact NURBS-equivalent B-reps, seam-invariant full right cylinders, and contact cases for two axis-aligned box
//    solids are classified constructively before the marcher, preserving distinct point-/edge-touching components
//    without welding.
