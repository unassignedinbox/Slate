# Architectural Plan: Swap Surfel GI with Distance Field GI (SDF GI)

**Date**: 2026-10-02
**Target Branch**: `arena/01a0fd52-frontier`
**Location**: `Plans/Ongoing/SwapSurfelGIWithDistanceFieldGI.md`

## Slate integration audit — 2026-10-02

**Status: imported, not a completed GPU replacement.** The sections below describe the upstream intended
architecture. The imported CPU renders are not captures from `Frontier.exe`.

The source at `7d5cb3c` allocates but never writes descriptor sets. The shader requires descriptor sets
0, 2 and 3, whereas the host provides only set 0. The host pushes 84 bytes with a different field layout
from the shader's 48 bytes. The surface cache is never allocated/populated and `SynchronizeField` only
increments counters. No reservoir producer is present. The GPU shader does not contain the CPU proof's
AO-neighborhood fix, mesh reflection or refraction implementation.

Slate therefore guards stage creation and dispatch with `DistanceFieldGIStage::TransportImplemented = false`.
Mode 1 uses the existing GI fallback and diagnostics report SDF unavailability rather than claiming activation.
The source and shader are built, but enabling SDF requires implementing and validating those resource contracts,
GPU field/cache/reservoir production, synchronization and shader transport first. The two stale
`SurfelPathRecorded` references were also corrected and shader lowering was registered in both toolchains.

The suggested dynamic-mesh SSGI and capsule proxies are future work, not implemented by this merge;
the quoted timing is not a measured result from this build.

## 1. Architectural Motivation & Render Mode Taxonomy

Frontier's three-way render mode matrix cleanly decouples primary visibility, indirect illumination transport, and specular transport:

| Mode Index | Raytracing Tile | Global Illumination Tile | Render Path Name | Primary Visibility | Diffuse Indirect GI | Direct Shadows | Specular Reflections | Glass Transport |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | **ON** | ON or OFF | **Raytraced ReSTIR** | Mesh Rasterization / BVH Hit | ReSTIR Spatiotemporal Reservoir | Raytraced Shadow Rays | Raytraced BVH (Multi-bounce) | Full Path Refraction |
| **1** | **OFF** | **ON** | **Distance Field GI (SDF GI)** | **Mesh Rasterization** | **Cascaded GDF Clipmaps + Surface Cache** | **Monotonic $k \cdot H / t$ Contact Soft Shadows** | **Raytraced BVH (Mesh, No SDF Blocks) / Sky** | **Snell's Law Refraction + Beer-Lambert** |
| **2** | **OFF** | **OFF** | **Plain Visibility Raster** | **Mesh Rasterization** | Sky Ambient Dome Direct | Cascaded Shadow Maps / Direct | Sky Dome | Sky Dome Transmission |

### Key Requirements Addressed
1. **Target Hardware**: GTX GPUs (No RT cores required; hardware RT disabled for Mode 1).
2. **Depth-Buffer Accelerated GI**: Primary visibility is rasterized first to produce the depth and G-buffer (`SurfaceImage`, `NormalImage`). Distance Field GI only evaluates shaded fragments that pass the depth buffer, completely skipping background and unoccluded sky pixels.
3. **Authentic Mesh ShaderBalls**: ShaderBalls are complex polygon meshes (outer slotted shell, inner core, floor mount), not plain mathematical spheres.
4. **Voxel SDF Artifact Elimination**: Raymarching voxelized SDF fields for specular reflections causes coarse, blocky artifacts on shiny surfaces. Specular reflections and glass refraction are therefore evaluated against mesh BVH geometry or analytic skies, and composited cleanly with the diffuse SDF GI.
5. **Monotonic Contact Soft Shadows**: Distance field shadowing uses the monotonic formula $S = \min(S, (k \cdot H) / t)$, avoiding singularity artifacts and black specks while preserving contact hardening.
6. **Continuous SDF Neighborhood Query**: Cell-based distance evaluation queries the 2×2 neighborhood to eliminate Voronoi boundary clamping discontinuities, resolving concentric stepping artifacts on the floor.

## 2. Engine Seam Integration

### 2.1 Host Ownership (`DistanceFieldGIStage`)
- **Header**: `Frontier/Engine/DeviceExchange/DistanceFieldGIStage.h`
  - Defines `DistanceFieldGIStage`, `DistanceFieldStageInit`, and `DistanceFieldFrameParams`.
  - Exposes lifecycle methods: `Bring()`, `Destroy()`, `SynchronizeField()`, and `RecordFrame()`.
- **Implementation**: `Frontier/Engine/DeviceExchange/DistanceFieldGIStage.cpp`
  - Allocates GPU storage buffers for Global Distance Field (GDF) 3D clipmaps and Surface Cache atlas allocations.
  - Creates the compute pipeline layout and descriptor sets with update-after-bind indexing.
  - Dispatches `DistanceFieldGIResolve.slang` (16×16 compute workgroups) with push constant parameters.

### 2.2 Swapchain Wiring (`SwapchainExchange`)
- Replaces legacy `SurfelGIStage` for `RenderPath == 1` inside `RecordComputeCommands()`.
- Adds `BringDistanceFieldGIStage()` and lifecycle management in `UploadScene()`, `RebuildSwapchain()`, and `Retire()`.
- Retains `SurfelStage` as a fallback safety layer if `DistanceFieldGIStage` is uninitialized.

### 2.3 Diagnostics and Runtime Routing
- `FrontierRuntime.cpp` and `ReSTIRIntegrator.h` updated to declare and log:
  ```
  Distance Field GI active: Cascaded GDF clipmaps, Surface Cache atlas, monotonic contact soft shadows (k*H/t), and multi-bounce emissive bleed. Evaluated against depth buffer. Specular reflection mode: raytraced (mesh BVH, no SDF blocks).
  ```

### 2.4 Multi-Toolchain Compliance
- Registered in `Frontier/CMakeLists.txt` (`FRONTIER_HOST_SOURCES`).
- Registered in `Frontier/Tools/Build/ToolchainSequence.ps1` (`$EngineRelative`).
- Validated via `Frontier/Tools/Build/CheckBuildSourceList.sh` (100% GREEN, 7/7 checks passed).
