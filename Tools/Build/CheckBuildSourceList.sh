# Keeps the two Windows build paths in agreement about which TUs make Project-Zero.exe.
#
#    On 2026-09-18 the user's build linked 82 of 82 objects and came back with 14 unresolved externals:
#    MaterialInspector (ControlCentreHost + GameExecution), InstanceAcceleration (GameExecution's D6/D7 scene), and
#    RenderShaderballPreview (M7b). All three implementations existed in the tree; they were simply not in
#    `ToolchainSequence.ps1`'s `$EngineRelative`. The list's own guard could not see it — it checks that every LISTED
#    file EXISTS, and the failure mode here is the opposite one: a file that exists, is referenced by the app, and is
#    not listed. CMakeLists.txt had them, which is why CMake builds and the PowerShell build did not.
#
#    This gate is the missing half, and it is deliberately dependency-free (bash + awk/sed/grep, like the other gates):
#
#      ① every CMake-listed TU exists on disk                        (a renamed file, from CMake's side)
#      ② every PS1-listed TU exists on disk                          (the PS1's own guard, re-checked here)
#      ③ CMake ⊆ PS1: nothing CMake compiles for the exe may be absent from the PS1 batch — this is the check that
#        would have caught 2026-09-18 before the user ever ran the build;
#      ④ every .cpp under Engine/ and Projects/Project-Zero/Source/ is either in a list or named in the allowlist
#        below with a reason — so a new TU cannot quietly land in neither build system;
#      ⑤ per-file overrides agree: every TU CMake gives extra defines/include dirs gets the same treatment here.
#      ⑥ the headless CPU reference agrees across all THREE of its lists (CMake, the Makefile, Construct.ps1) — it is
#        built on the sandbox side too, so a divergence there breaks the CPU work as well as the product;
#      ⑦ Project-Dyno agrees between CMake and its own ToolchainSequence.ps1.
#
#    Every list in the repo that names .cpp files by hand is covered here. If a new build target grows one, add it.
#
