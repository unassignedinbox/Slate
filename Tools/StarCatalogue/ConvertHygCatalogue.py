#  ConvertHygCatalogue.py — HYG astronomical database → Slate's compact star catalogue
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#  The HYG database is 119 000 stars and about 35 MB of CSV. Slate needs four numbers from ~9 000 of them, so the
#  conversion is a 240× reduction and the result is a reasonable thing to keep in a repository.
#
#  🔴 The converter is committed, not just its output. An opaque binary blob in a source tree is a liability: no
#  reader can tell what produced it, whether it is current, or how to regenerate it after a bug. This script plus
#  the documented source URL means the asset is always reproducible.
#
#  Usage:
#      curl -L -o hygdata_v41.csv \
#          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronexus/HYG-Database/main/hyg/CURRENT/hygdata_v41.csv
#      python3 Tools/StarCatalogue/ConvertHygCatalogue.py hygdata_v41.csv \
#          EngineContent/StarCatalogue/BrightStars.bin
#
#  HYG is CC BY-SA 4.0 (astronexus/HYG-Database). It aggregates Hipparcos, Yale Bright Star and Gliese.
