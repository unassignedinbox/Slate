//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 Executes dimensions and constraints -- their geometry, their placement, their editing and the unit
//    conversion around them -- and proves each against what it MEANS rather than against a recording.
//
// 🔴 A DIMENSION STORES NO COORDINATES, AND SECTION 1 PROVES IT THE ONLY WAY THAT COUNTS: by moving the
//    geometry afterwards and re-asking. If a dimension ever cached the endpoints it was placed against,
//    it would keep reporting the old span and would draw in the old place. Every other claim about
//    dimensions is worthless if this one does not hold.
//
// 🔴 THE OFFSET'S SIGN IS THE SIDE IT DRAWS ON. Section 2 puts the pointer on each side of an edge in
//    turn and insists the offsets come back with opposite signs and the dimension line lands on opposite
//    sides. An implementation taking the magnitude passes every "is it 20 units away" test ever written
//    and still sticks the dimension to one side forever.
//
// 🔴 A TYPED VALUE GOES THROUGH THE SOLVER, AND A REFUSAL CHANGES NOTHING. Section 5 asks for a value the
//    sketch cannot take and insists the geometry is byte-for-byte what it was. A direct parameter write
//    cannot fail, which sounds like a virtue and means the sketch can never tell you it is
//    over-constrained.
//
// 🔴 SWITCHING UNITS MUST NEVER TOUCH GEOMETRY. Section 6 round-trips through all four units and demands
//    the stored millimetres are bit-identical afterwards. A conversion leaking into the model rescales
//    the drawing, and the damage looks exactly like a solver bug.
//
// 📝 Negative-tested. Taking the offset's magnitude, caching a dimension's span, writing a typed value
//    straight into the target, and converting on the way in as well as out each refute a section below.
