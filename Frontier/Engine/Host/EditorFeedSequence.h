// 🧩 The development editor's live feed: the outliner roster and the inspector sheet, both read off the loaded
//    level every tick. No tables, no scene names — the same walk feeds the material grid, the showroom and the
//    shader ball, because every figure comes from placements, instances, materials or the camera.
//
//    Roster layout (preorder, folders always in this order):
//        Room        — static scenery placements (no emissive triangles, no luminaire, no camera)
//        Objects     — dynamic placements (the DYN badge: --animate and physics drive these)
//        Lighting    — emissive placements and luminaire carriers
//        Cameras     — the fly camera ("Main Camera"), then any cameras the file carries
//    A folder's rows follow it, deepened by Depth, exactly as the panel renders them.
//
//    Sheets are UI mirrors: every figure is read live at pick time, and the panel edits the mirror until a
//    write-back lands. Ranges repeat the configuration comments, so no slider can propose a figure its owner
//    cannot hold. One write-back crosses the seam (see the tick in GameExecution): the folder tint mirror.
