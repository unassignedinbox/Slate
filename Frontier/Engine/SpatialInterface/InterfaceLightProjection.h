// 🧩 The panel as a light source. Until now the interface has been an overlay: composited over the resolved image,
//    contributing nothing to the room. A real display lights what is near it and shows up in anything reflective,
//    and the chrome sphere sitting under the showroom panel makes its absence obvious.
//
//    This projects the composed figures onto a single emissive PROXY QUAD registered into the scene before the
//    acceleration structure is built. The renderer then treats it like any other emitter — no new light path, no
//    shader branch in the integrator, no change to the luminaire format. The panel lights the plinth and appears
//    in the sphere because it is, as far as the tracer is concerned, an ordinary glowing rectangle.
//
//    Tiers (References/InterfaceLightContribution-Plan.md, resolved earlier):
//        Off    no proxy at all — overlay only, exactly today's behaviour, zero cost
//        Low    proxy in the light list, radiance = the area-weighted average of the lit figures   ← default
//        High   same geometry and same luminaire; the hit shader evaluates the figures instead of the average
//        Ultra  one luminaire per emissive figure, so a single lit button casts its own shaped pool
//
//    Off and Low are implemented here end to end. HIGH's sampler is built and proven —
//    Shaders/InterfacePanelSample.slang walks the figures at a hit's plane coordinate and is verified against the
//    Low-tier average to four decimals (Scratchpad/CheckPanelSample.sh) — but it is not yet REACHABLE from the
//    ray-tracing kernel: the figure buffer lives in InterfaceExchange's own descriptor set, and the kernel's set
//    is full to binding 18, which is the variable-count bindless array and must stay last. Wiring it needs a
//    descriptor renumber that touches every write site.
//
//    So High still reports itself unavailable. That is deliberate and worth stating plainly: the geometry is
//    done, the plumbing is not, and a tier that silently fell back to Low would hide exactly that distinction.
//    Ultra needs the same plumbing plus per-figure luminaires.
//
//    Engine ⇄ project seam: this knows figures have colour, area and an emissive weight. It does not know which
//    figure is a warning lamp. The project picks the tier and owns the panel's placement.
