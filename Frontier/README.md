# Frontier

**One repository for the native engine, editor, projects, runtime assets and browser experiments.**

The engine/editor sources are checked in directly. You do **not** need to clone another Frontier repository, find missing source files or apply the old engine patch chain. Third-party libraries are downloaded automatically from an immutable, checksummed dependency lockfile.

## Build guide and dependency recovery

**[Complete project build instructions and external-package troubleshooting](Docs/Building.md)** — Project-Zero, Dyno, Fluid, the native CPU proof, SolidArc and browser projects.

Normal native builds now **check installed dependencies without downloading**. Install/repair is a separate step; Windows drivers accept `-SetupDependencies` only when you explicitly want setup during a build.

If packages are already downloaded, **do not delete the whole `ExternalPackages` folder**:

```powershell
# Diagnose all dependencies locally, with no network:
python Tools/Bootstrap.py --check
# Example: restore only a damaged managed ImGui installation from the archive cache:
python Tools/Bootstrap.py --package imgui --repair --offline
# If a download is actually needed and Python HTTPS fails, use verified curl:
python Tools/Bootstrap.py --package imgui --repair --downloader curl
```

Repair preserves the previous managed folder in `ExternalPackages/.frontier-backups/`. Keep `.cache/dependency-archives/` when updating the codebase, or use `FRONTIER_DEPENDENCY_CACHE` for a shared cache. Ready installations never need their archives redownloaded. See the guide for pin mismatches, unmanaged folders, missing `.lib` files, Vulkan SDK errors, proxies and trusted CA bundles. **Never disable TLS verification.**

## Start here

Prerequisites: **Python 3.11+, Git, CMake 3.21+, Ninja and a C++20 compiler**. On Windows, use a Visual Studio x64 developer terminal with the C++ desktop workload installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/streamlinkinbox/Frontier.git
cd Frontier
python Tools/Setup.py --verify
```

On systems where Python is named `python3`, use that instead. No GitHub account/token is needed for the public dependency downloads. The first run downloads libraries; subsequent runs reuse them.

`--verify` builds the **actual native editor and CPU scene-rendering proof**, then runs the billboard/inspector synchronization and setup-safety tests. It does not launch the Vulkan game. Generated captures and the test log go to:

```text
build/native-proof/evidence/
```

For setup without compiling, run `python Tools/Setup.py`. To install all application/import/physics dependencies as well, add `--all-dependencies`.

## Native application — Windows

In addition to the prerequisites above, install the **Vulkan SDK** and a Vulkan-capable graphics driver. `VULKAN_SDK` must point to the SDK.

```powershell
python Tools/Setup.py --all-dependencies
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Projects/Project-Zero/Build/ToolchainSequence.ps1 -Development -Run
```

The build driver uses this checkout's source and locked dependencies. GLFW and ThorVG build helpers are included; Jolt's helper path is corrected. No recursive submodule checkout or disabled TLS verification is required.

**The complete Windows/Vulkan application has not been executed in this Linux environment.** The CPU proof passing is not a GPU-weather-parity claim. The native CPU render/inspector checks are the verified path; see [consolidation status](Docs/Consolidation.md) for remaining boundaries.

## Native application — Linux

Install the Vulkan SDK, GLFW's X11/Wayland development prerequisites and a shader compiler (`glslc` or compatible `slangc`), then:

```sh
python3 Tools/Setup.py --all-dependencies
cmake --preset linux-app
cmake --build --preset linux-app
```

The full Linux Vulkan application is not yet an executed verification target here. Use the `native-proof` preset for the tested headless path.

## Browser editor and galleries

Requires **Node.js 20.19+ / npm**. The browser experiment is separate from the native editor, but included in this repository.

```sh
npm --prefix Experimental/FrontierEditor ci
npm --prefix Experimental/FrontierEditor run dev -- --port 5173
```

Open the displayed URL. Pages: `/`, `/icons.html`, `/collection-icon-options.html`.

```sh
npm --prefix Experimental/FrontierEditor run build
```

Or install/build it alongside native setup with `python Tools/Setup.py --browser`.

## SolidArc

```sh
cmake -S Editor/AuthoringTools/Modelling/SolidArc -B build/solidarc
cmake --build build/solidarc --target SolidArc SolidArcVerification --parallel 3
ctest --test-dir build/solidarc --output-on-failure
```

## Reproducibility and provenance

- [Consolidation details and verification](Docs/Consolidation.md)
- [Source/dependency notices](NOTICE.md)
- [Dependency setup](ExternalPackages/README.md)
- [Optional CI template](Tools/CI/README.md) (not yet activated)
- [Native billboards and renderer evidence](Exhibits/Workbench/Billboards/Native.md)

Older research documents describe the former multi-repository arrangement. Historical patches and reconstruction scripts are preserved for provenance; **they are not the normal setup/build route**. Start with the commands above. Large untracked historical screenshot bundles are not needed to build; previously committed automotive evidence is retained; new proof captures are generated in `build/`. Browser design history is preserved in [Docs/BrowserEditorHistory.md](Docs/BrowserEditorHistory.md).

## Water prototype

Flux/Ripple are included with a tested **load-time Ripple mesh bridge**, not live main-engine fluid simulation. Build/test with `cmake --preset fluid-cpu`, `cmake --build --preset fluid-cpu`, then `ctest --preset fluid-cpu`. The rebuilt Project-Zero accepts `--water-body-snapshot`. See [scope, commands, measurements and limitations](Docs/WaterIntegration.md).

## GPU fluid tests and startup memory logs

Project-Zero now has `--fluid-preview`, `--fluid-gpu-test` and `--fluid-cpu-test` modes. The GPU extraction implementation has a tested CPU mirror; hardware execution remains unverified. [Build/run instructions, scope, logging and RAM investigation](Docs/FluidGpuTesting.md).

## Startup timing and RAM reports

Use `python Tools/Build/ReportStartup.py PATH_TO_STARTUP.csv --output Build/Diagnostics/startup-report.md` to count overlapping worker intervals once and inspect resident/peak/committed memory separately. [How to compare logs with Task Manager](Docs/StartupReporting.md). New logs include the process ID and render-loop memory samples about every ten seconds.

Shader startup also prints `[GPU startup]` stage names and five-second heartbeats while shader-module/pipeline creation calls are pending, including elapsed time and process RAM. This is diagnostic activity reporting, not a GPU compilation percentage. See [live startup progress](Docs/StartupReporting.md#live-shader--vulkan-preparation-progress).

For the measured ReSTIR pipeline stall (first run >316 seconds, second run 0.45 seconds), see [the investigation, cache checkpoints and opt-in diagnostic tests](Docs/ReSTIRPipelineInvestigation.md). Default rendering optimization is unchanged; the diagnostic modes are not a confirmed driver fix.
