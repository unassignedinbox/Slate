# Flattened engine tree

`Frontier/` at the repository root is the engine. It is one ordinary source tree: the upstream base with every
change this work produced already merged into it. You build it directly. There is no clone step, no seat step,
no overlay copy pass and no patch script — those are gone, not bypassed.

Dependencies are the single documented exception. They are fetched into `Frontier/ExternalPackages/` by the
engine's own `Tools/Bootstrap.py` and are git-ignored, exactly as upstream intends.

## Building

```bash
cd Frontier
python3 Tools/Bootstrap.py --profile proof     # dependencies — the one fetch step
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build
```

The CPU proof harnesses build straight off the same tree, from the repository root:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -w -DFRONTIER_CPU_PORT -pthread \
    -IFrontier/Engine -IFrontier -IFrontier/ExternalPackages/vulkan-headers/include \
    VisualProof/MaterialParity/MaterialParityProof.cpp \
    Frontier/Engine/ContentInterchange/ShowcaseStructure.cpp \
    Frontier/Engine/ContentInterchange/ShaderBallGeometry.cpp \
    Frontier/Engine/ContentInterchange/MaterialIndex.cpp \
    Frontier/Engine/GeometricRaster/GeometryStructure.cpp \
    Frontier/Engine/DeviceExchange/OrientationClassifier.cpp \
    Frontier/Engine/DisplayPresentation/ShadingTableCodec.cpp \
    -o _AgentScratch/build/parity/MaterialParityProof
```

## Provenance

| Layer | Source | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Base | `SultanAladin/Frontier-` @ `28ec0657a23ed6bbf680f17cc06b464a53639dae` | copied verbatim |
| Render work | `FlattenedEngine/` | 74 files unique to it, copied verbatim |
| Vehicle + r7 work | `VehiclePhysics/Overlay/` | 91 files unique to it, copied verbatim |
| Both touched 5 files | three-way merge, base = the pinned checkout | merged clean, no conflict markers |
| Both added 3 surfel shaders | no common ancestor | resolved to the `Overlay` copies |
| Modelling tool | `Engine/AuthoringTools/SolidArc/` | 216 files added, 13 updated |
| Drive level host edits | `DriveLevelPatch.py` | 11 edits baked in permanently |

The three files with no common ancestor are `Engine/Shaders/SurfelCommit.slang`, `SurfelGIResolve.slang` and
`SurfelIrradianceUpdate.slang`. `SurfelCommit.slang` was byte-identical on both sides. The other two were
resolved to the `Overlay` copies because only those carry the `ResolveMaterial` unification and the
`SkyAlongApprox` replacement for the `samplerCube SkyCube` that the engine never bound — the `FlattenedEngine`
copies are the older, unrunnable versions.

The five three-way merges were `Engine/DisplayPresentation/ControlCentreHost.{cpp,h}`,
`Engine/DisplayPresentation/ReSTIRIntegrator.h`, `Engine/GeometricRaster/VisibilityRaster.cpp` and
`Engine/Shaders/ReSTIRViewport.slang`.

## What was deliberately left out

- `EngineContent/GeometryArchives` (90 MB) and `EngineContent/FontArchives` (23 MB) — runtime archives, not
  code. Everything else under `EngineContent/` was kept, because `CMakeLists.txt` globs
  `EngineContent/Icons/*.svg` at configure time and a code-only copy would not configure.
- Upstream binary artefacts and build caches.

## Preserved alternates

`Frontier/References/AlternateStarSizeClamp/` holds the star size-clamp variant of
`Engine/Shaders/PostRecords.slang` and `Engine/GeometricRaster/VisibilityRaster.cpp`. It is mutually exclusive
with the Gaussian star profile the tree ships, so it is kept as reference rather than merged.

## Pruning

Eleven `.cpp` files were deleted: they were referenced by neither `CMakeLists.txt` nor any surviving `#include`
after the new CMake relocated `Projects/Project-Zero/Source/*.cpp` to `Engine/Host/*.cpp`. The relocation is
**not** a pure move — `RayTracingSolver.{h,cpp}` is listed by a second CMake target under its original path, so
the obvious "delete the old twins" pass is wrong. Of the 28 name matches, 17 are still referenced and were kept.

`Projects/Project-Physics/` is named 9 times by `CMakeLists.txt` and does not exist. That is a pre-existing
upstream condition, present identically in the base checkout, and the flatten neither caused nor fixed it.

## Verification

Run against the flattened tree after the merge, all green:

| Proof | Result |
|---|---|
| `VisualProof/MaterialParity` | 29 / 29 passed |
| `VisualProof/SharedTopology` | 25 / 25 passed |
| `ShowcaseTransportMirror` | renders; BLAS 67 832 triangles, TLAS 381 placements |
| `Frontier/Tools/Build/CheckSolidArc.sh` | compiles and passes |

## Follow-up cleanup

- `MaterialLevelViewport::TranscribeShadingRecord` deleted. It was byte-identical to
  `Frontier::UnifiedMaterial::MakeShadingRecord`, which had already been lifted out of it into
  `ContentInterchange/UnifiedMaterialEvaluation.h`; both call sites now use the shared one, so there is a single
  `MaterialSlabRecord` → `ShadingRecord` transcription.
- `ShowcaseRasterMirror` bumped r6 → r7. It is **not** redundant against `ShowcaseTransportMirror`: this one
  drives the engine's shipped `GeometricRaster/VisibilityRaster` and the real `Host/CelestialSequence` sky, which
  is the product's GI-OFF / RT-OFF mode. The transport mirror authors its own BVH raster for comparing transports.
  It was also moved onto `Frontier::HostRuntime`, and its r7 source list gained `ShaderBallGeometry` and
  `ShadingTableCodec`.
- `RunProjectZeroMirror` prose corrected: 400 **placements**, being 380 ShaderBalls plus the 20 emissive spheres
  of row 8 — not "400 spheres".

### ⚠️ The relocation also moved the mirrors' sources

The eleven `.cpp` files pruned from `Projects/Project-Zero/Source/` all exist at `Engine/Host/`, under namespace
`Frontier::HostRuntime` rather than `Frontier::ProjectZero`. Nothing was lost, but the orchestration scripts named
the pre-relocation paths and had to be repointed. If another consumer surfaces, the file is at `Engine/Host/` and
the namespace changed with it.

## Windows build (the route that actually works)

**CMake is not the Windows route.** `CMakeLists.txt` hard-errors under `WIN32 AND MSVC` and redirects you. CMake is
for Linux/macOS and IDE integration only.

```powershell
cd Frontier
python Tools\Bootstrap.py --profile proof        # dependencies; prints "Frontier ready."
powershell -File Tools\Build\ToolchainSequence.ps1 -Run
```

Useful switches: `-Configuration Debug`, `-Rebuild`, `-Isa AVX|AVX2` (must match `BuildJolt.ps1` or
`RegisterTypes()` aborts on a library/client mismatch), `-Development:$false` for a ship build without the editor.

### Why you saw two output folders — it is by design

| Artefact | Lands in |
|---|---|
| `Frontier.exe` and its payload | `Frontier/Build/Output/Windows/<Configuration>/Binary` |
| object files | `Frontier/Build/Output/Windows/<Configuration>/Object` |
| `ProjectZero.dll` | `Frontier/Projects/Project-Zero/Build` |
| `ProjectDrive.dll` | `Frontier/Projects/Project-Drive/Build` |

The project code images are deliberately separate `/DLL` links placed beside their project, so editing project
semantics does not relink `Frontier.exe`. `-FluidOpenMP` adds a `-FluidOpenMP` suffix to the output root to keep
objects built in a different compiler mode isolated. The CMake presets write somewhere else again
(`Frontier/build/<preset>`), which is the other folder you remember.

`Frontier.exe` is launched from the repository root with a project specification:

```text
Frontier.exe Projects\Project-Zero\ProjectZero.frontier
```

### Faults found and fixed on 2026-10-01

- **`ShaderBallGeometry.cpp` was in neither source list.** `ShowcaseStructure::BringGridMesh` calls
  `ShaderBallGeometry::LoadResolved`, so `Frontier.exe` failed to link with an unresolved external on both build
  paths. Added to `CMakeLists.txt` and `ToolchainSequence.ps1`.
- **`Tools/Build/CheckBuildSourceList.sh` was reporting a false RED** and hiding the above. It parsed
  `Projects/Project-Zero/Build/ToolchainSequence.ps1`, which is now only a forwarding shim, so it saw zero
  PowerShell TUs; and it never read `FRONTIER_HOST_SOURCES`. Both fixed — run this gate with any build change.
- **The dependency manifest was being ignored.** Slate's ignore rule covered all of
  `Frontier/ExternalPackages/`, including `Dependencies.lock.json`, so `Tools/Bootstrap.py` could not run from a
  fresh clone. The rule now mirrors the engine's own: ignore the contents, track the lock file and README.

### Known gap: Project-Drive has no simulation linked

`ProjectDrive.dll` is a thin C-ABI shim — it registers panels and scene subjects and nothing else. The nine
vehicle physics TUs (`Engine/PhysicalDynamics/Vehicle/*` plus `VehiclePhysicsThread.cpp` and
`XPBDTyreSolver.cpp`) are compiled into **no** image, and no built translation unit references them. Project-Drive
will load and show its panels; it will not drive. These are recorded as explicit allowlist entries in the gate
rather than left as silent omissions.

## Viewport traversal ownership

`Frontier/Engine/DeviceExchange/RayQueryExchange` owns optional Vulkan triangle BLAS/TLAS resources and queue-ordered
placement refits. `SwapchainExchange` selects its hardware-query program only after those resources and the shader
are resident; unsupported devices retain the software BVH program. A ray-pipeline capability is not an executed
ray pipeline: the implemented hardware route is inline `VK_KHR_ray_query`.

The shader entry points `ReSTIRViewport`, `RayQueryViewport` and `RasterViewport` share `ViewportIntegrator`.
Raster reads material/visibility records and shadow maps without reservoir access; sky and weather do not enable
ReSTIR implicitly. `Tools/Tests/CheckViewportPrograms.py` checks the compiled SPIR-V resource separation.
