# ShaderBall material grid — all families, all three modes

`ShaderBall20x20_ThreePaths.png` is the current **20×20 = 400-material** parity proof. Every cell uses the public-domain
[derkreature ShaderBall](ShaderBallAsset/ORIGIN.md), reduced only for deterministic CPU raster verification. The original
Unlicense is retained beside it. Left to right, the three panels are:

1. Visibility raster — ray tracing off, GI off, reflections off.
2. Surfel GI — ray tracing off, GI on, sky reflection enabled.
3. ReSTIR — ray tracing on, GI on, traced reflection/refraction enabled.

The modes are also rendered as separate CPU-reference images so each can be inspected at full size:

- `ShaderBall20x20_VisibilityRaster_CPU.png`
- `ShaderBall20x20_SurfelGI_CPU.png`
- `ShaderBall20x20_ReSTIR_CPU.png`

All panels call one `EvaluateMaterial` routine. Only `TransportShade` changes between panels. The executable hashes every
resolved material response before transport and fails unless all three hashes are identical. The committed proof reports
`efddf784ca0caa8a` for all three paths.

The 20 rows cover IOR/F0, angular Fresnel response (including F20/F90), polished conductor colour, rough conductor,
procedural wood, glitter, automotive metallic flake/coat, polymer, procedural paper fibre, woven fabric/sheen,
subsurface wax/skin, clear glass, absorbing glass, thin film, clear coat, brushed anisotropic metal, rubber, ceramic,
emission, and layered showpieces. Columns sweep hue or the row's principal physical parameter.

Reproduce from the repository root:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 Exhibits/Workbench/Materials/ShaderBallGridProof.cpp -o ShaderBallGridProof
./ShaderBallGridProof
```

The GPU correction follows the same rule. `SurfelMaterialEvaluation.slang` reads the engine's real
`MaterialRecord`/`MaterialSlabRecord` tables and invokes the same `ResolveLayers` and `EvaluateBsdf` implementation as
ReSTIR. Both the Surfel irradiance update and final resolve use it; the old albedo/metalness/roughness approximation is no
longer the material path. `MaterialAux.z` now carries only the primary material index needed to address those shared tables.

## Legacy 15×15 sphere proof

`ShowcaseGrid_Modes.png` is the earlier engine **15×15 = 225-sphere material showcase**
(`ContentInterchange/ShowcaseStructure.cpp`, the r4 generator — the same grid the flake / denoiser /
material work rendered) run through **all three render-mode paths** by the CPU mirror
(`../CpuMirror/ModeMatrix.cpp --scene grid`). It proves every OpenPBR family shades correctly regardless of
which pipeline is active — the guarantee the GPU aux G-buffer (`../HostWiring/Patches/SurfaceResolve_MaterialAux.patch`)
provides on the device.

15 rows = 15 material **families**, 15 columns = a hue + parameter sweep inside the family (spheres r=0.55,
spacing 1.5, exactly as `MaterialLevelViewport`'s grid). The mirror was given a real multi-lobe material model
— **metal, specular roughness, dielectric transmission (glass) with Beer–Lambert absorption, emission, clear
coat / car paint, thin-film iridescence, cloth/fuzz sheen, subsurface, and glint flakes** — so each family is
distinct:

| Row | Family | Row | Family |
|----|--------|----|--------|
| 0 | anisotropic metal (hue-tinted polish ladder) | 8 | **emission** (luminaire rainbow) |
| 1 | **transmissive glass** (IOR 1.30→2.42, tinted) | 9 | rough metal (roughness ladder) |
| 2 | subsurface (scatter hue sweep) | 10 | dielectric→metal morph |
| 3 | **thin film** over dark/gold/black | 11 | ceramic / rubber (alternating) |
| 4 | **cloth / fuzz** (velvet sheen ramp) | 12 | **glint flakes** (density 1→8) |
| 5 | **coat / car paint** (coat-roughness ramp) | 13 | **absorbing glass** (tint deepening) |
| 6 | haziness (broad second gloss lobe) | 14 | showpieces: chrome · black-gloss · pearl · gold · frosted glass |
| 7 | EON diffuse (hue rainbow) | | |

### What each mode shows (same scene, same materials)

| Tile | Path | Tells |
|---|---|---|
| `grid_plainraster.png` | RT off, GI off | flat sky-ambient + direct. Every family reads correctly — flakes sparkle, emission glows, cloth is matte-sheened, and **glass genuinely transmits the scene** (see note below). |
| `grid_surfelgi.png` | RT off, GI on | adds inter-sphere GI + contact darkening; richer colour bleed between neighbours. Glass still transmits the real scene, opaque reflections stay sky-only. |
| `grid_raytraced.png` | RT on | true **raytraced reflection AND refraction**: glass shows the scene through it, metals reflect their neighbours, the glint-flake row sparkles with real specular facets, hero chrome/gold mirror the field. |

#### Glass transmission in the non-RT modes (fix)
Earlier the plain-raster / surfel-GI glass looked **flat/frosted**: those paths refracted only the
smooth sky, so a glass sphere over featureless environment had nothing to transmit. The CPU mirror
now shades dielectric transmission with a **recursive analytic refraction trace** (`shadeAnalytic`,
bounded to depth 4): the refracted ray is intersected against the actual scene geometry and shaded
with the *current mode's* lighting (surfel GI or flat sky-ambient). So glass transmits real geometry
in **every** pipeline, not just when RT is on — it merely gains true multi-bounce accuracy under RT.
A **studio checkerboard floor** was added to the ground quad so the transmitted/reflected structure
is legible (an unbroken environment made the effect invisible regardless of correctness).

Rendered 660×480, 130 frames, 44 spp (raytraced), surfel field converged to ~44 k surfels
(frame-to-frame flicker 2×10⁻⁵).

### Reproduce
```bash
cd ../CpuMirror
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -pthread ModeMatrix.cpp -o ModeMatrix
./ModeMatrix --scene grid --w 660 --h 480 --frames 130 --rays 8 --direct 48 --spp 44
# writes mode_{plainraster,surfelgi,raytraced}.ppm   (--scene grid|glint|emissive; grid is the default)
```

## Flakes on the non-raytraced paths (#30)

`GlintSheet_Modes.png` — a close row of glint-flake spheres (density ramping 0.6 → 8 left→right) rendered through
all three modes. Earlier, flakes only sparkled under the path tracer: on the non-RT paths a flake was a mirror
aligned with the surface normal, so a cluster of flakes all reflected the *same* smooth sky direction and read as
a flat patch. Two changes fix it, and they are physically the right ones:

1. **Sun disc in the sky** (`skyColor`): a bright, ~1.5° sun + aureole. Without a sharp feature in the environment
   there is nothing for a specular surface to catch, so metals and flakes looked flat regardless of the path.
2. **Per-flake facet normals** (`flakeFacetNormal`): a fired flake is a *randomly-tilted micro-mirror*, deterministic
   per cell. Each facet reflects the environment in its own direction, so a cluster flashes bright/dark (and
   occasionally flares white on the sun) — the tilted-microfacet basis of the Deliot–Belcour flake model reduced to
   one representative facet per cell.

Result: flakes now sparkle at Standard fidelity on **plain raster and surfel GI**, not only under RT (RT still has
the highest contrast because its facets reflect the real dark ground).

### Re-render (fix): flakes were reading as blocky squares, not sparkle
The first `GlintSheet_Modes.png` looked **bugged** — the flakes appeared as big dark *square* blotches rather than
fine sparkle. That was three compounding problems, all now fixed:

1. **Cells far too large.** `glintScale` was `5..12`; with an `R=0.7` sphere that is only **~7–17 flake cells across
   the whole sphere**, so each cell covered many pixels and read as a square tile. Scale is now **`45..120`**
   (~60–170 cells across the sphere → sub-mm flakes that read as sparkle). The finer-to-the-right ramp is preserved.
2. **No antialiasing on the raster/GI paths.** Those paths shaded exactly one primary ray per pixel, so the flake
   pattern (keyed to hit position `P`) aliased hard at cell edges. Added **`--aa N` NxN primary-ray supersampling**
   (jittered primary rays, re-traced fresh); the sheet is rendered at `--aa 3`, which dissolves the hard edges into
   smooth sparkle. `--aa 1` keeps the old one-sample behaviour.
3. **Pure-black downward facets.** A fired facet reflecting the dark `ground` colour returned near-black, so a run of
   them looked like holes. A fired flake now **blends 30 % of the smooth body reflection into the facet sample**, so a
   downward-pointing facet keeps a metal sheen instead of punching a black square.

Reproduce (the committed sheet):
```bash
./ModeMatrix --scene glint --w 560 --h 390 --aa 3 --frames 200 --spp 16
```

## Materials through the multi-slab (layered) path (#29)

`MultiSlab_Compare.png` — the full 15-family grid rendered through the flat single-slab shader (left) and the new
**layered multi-slab stack** (right), surfel-GI mode. The flat path sums every lobe unconditionally; the stack path
(`shadeStack`, enabled with `--slabs`) instead evaluates the material as an **ordered stack of slabs** composited
top→bottom with an energy throughput `T`:

```
  clear-coat slab  → reflects F·T of the env, passes (1-F)·T down
  glint-flake slab → tilted-facet reflection, covers most of what's beneath where it fires
  base slab        → conductor (terminates the stack)  OR  dielectric-spec over a diffuse/SSS slab
  (fuzz sheen, emission, glass-as-interface-stack handled in-line)
```

This is the Tier-B multi-slab layout (roadmap #10/#29): coat-over-flake-over-metal/pigment resolved as *layers*, not
a blend. **Every one of the 15 families still resolves correctly through the stack** (RMSE vs the flat path ≈ 1.6 %),
and the small differences are an *improvement* — the layered path conserves energy (the coat no longer double-counts
with the base). Reproduce:
```bash
./ModeMatrix --scene grid --slabs --w 560 --h 410 --frames 110 --rays 6 --direct 36 --spp 26
```
