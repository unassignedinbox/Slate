# Patches — Slate's divergence from vendored ImGui

Two patches, both against `ExternalPackages/imgui` at commit `12b7977` (`1.92.9 WIP`, `docking` branch).
They are the **whole** of Slate's divergence from upstream ImGui. `Scripts/ApplyImGuiPatches.ps1` applies
them and `Build/Construct.ps1` invokes that script before any unit is translated.

🔴 Never edit `ExternalPackages/` by hand. A silently adjusted vendored dependency is a defect that
reproduces on one machine only — `14` §2. The divergence lives here, as a file a reader can open.

## Why patch rather than write a docking system

`References/DockWorkspace.html` wants trapezoidal, interlocking tabs. Everything else it does —
splitters, dock trees, five-way drop targets, floating windows, layout persistence, tab reordering — is
already in ImGui's docking branch and is the hard, boring 95 % of a docking system. The divergence
needed to reach the sheet's appearance is 120 lines across four files, because ImGui already separates
tab *shape* from tab *behaviour*: `ItemAdd()` and every drag path hit-test the rectangular `bb`, exactly
as the sheet's SVG is `pointer-events:none` over a rectangular `<div>`.

## The patches

| Patch | Adds | Touches |
|-------|------|---------|
| `PatchA-TrapezoidalTabs.patch`  | `TabSlant` | `imgui.h`, `imgui.cpp`, `imgui_widgets.cpp` |

| `PatchB-TabOverlapZOrder.patch` | `TabOverlap`, `TabHeight`, `TabStripPadTop` | all four files |

`A` is independently applicable. `B` stacks on `A` and cannot apply first — its context includes A's
lines.

### A — the trapezoid

Replaces the body of `TabItemBackground()`, the one function that paints tab geometry, reached from four
call sites. The sheet's `tabPath(w,h)` states `slant = min(14, w * 0.16)` over the outline
`[0,h] [slant,0] [w-slant,0] [w,h]`, upper corners rounded, lower corners square. The sheet's
`roundedPath()` insets along both incident edges and joins the two inset points with a quadratic through
the corner — which is `PathBezierQuadraticCurveTo` exactly, so the curve is the browser's own and not an
approximation of it.

### B — interlock, height, strip, and z-order

- **Overlap** — one term subtracted from the tab advance in `TabBarLayout`, reproducing the sheet's
  `margin-right:-24px`. Every width and hit rectangle still reads `tab->Width`, which is unchanged.
- **Height and strip** — `TabHeight` overrides the derived bar height; `TabStripPadTop` reserves the
  band above the tabs that the sheet's 28 px strip shows over a 24 px tab seated at `flex-end`.
- **Z-order** — overlapping tabs are submitted leading-to-trailing, so a selected tab is buried under
  every tab after it. An `ImDrawListSplitter` on the tab bar gives two channels: quiet tabs record into
  the lower, the selected or hovered tab into the upper, merged at `EndTabBar`. This is the mechanism
  ImGui already uses for tables. **The splitter opens only when `TabOverlap > 0`**, so a stock
  configuration records the identical command stream it always did.

## Every member defaults to zero

`TabSlant`, `TabOverlap`, `TabHeight` and `TabStripPadTop` all default to `0.0f`, and each guards its
own behaviour behind `> 0.0f`. With default style the patched build emits a **byte-identical** command
stream to unpatched ImGui — verified by rasterising both and comparing the images. All four are carried
by `ImGuiStyle::ScaleAllSizes`, so a slant fixed at 14 is not half as steep on a 2× display.

## The sheet's own figures

| Style member | Sheet | Source |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| `TabSlant`         | `14.0f` | `slant = Math.min(14, w * 0.16)` |
| `TabOverlap`       | `24.0f` | `.tab { margin-right: -24px }` |
| `TabHeight`        | `24.0f` | `.tab { height: 24px }` |
| `TabStripPadTop`   | `4.0f`  | `.tabstrip { height: 28px }` at `align-items: flex-end` |
| `TabRounding`      | `0.0f`  | the sheet's `roundCorners` is off by default |
| `TabBorderSize`    | `0.0f`  | no border requested |
| `FramePadding.x`   | `38.0f` | `.tab { padding: 0 38px }` |
| `TabMinWidthShrink`| `170.0f`| `.tab { min-width: 170px }` |

⚠️ `TabOverlap` and `FramePadding.x` are coupled. The sheet's 38 px horizontal padding exists to clear
slant plus overlap; raising the overlap without raising the padding runs adjacent labels together.

## Upgrading ImGui

`ApplyImGuiPatches.ps1` reports when the submodule stands at a commit other than `12b7977` rather than
asserting, because a deliberate upgrade should reach a message naming both commits. After an upgrade,
re-cut both patches against the new tree and re-check `TabItemBackground`, `TabBarLayout` and
`BeginTabBar` — those three are the only functions either patch touches.

```powershell
powershell -File Scripts\ApplyImGuiPatches.ps1            # apply, idempotent
powershell -File Scripts\ApplyImGuiPatches.ps1 -Verify    # report which stand applied
powershell -File Scripts\ApplyImGuiPatches.ps1 -Revert    # restore pristine, in reverse order
```

🔴 Application is detected by the `SLATE PATCH A` / `SLATE PATCH B` sentinels, **not** by
`git apply --reverse --check`. B edits lines inside A's context, so once B is applied A no longer
reverse-checks — a reverse-check would report A absent on a fully patched tree and re-apply it, aborting
a build whose tree was perfectly healthy.
