//  PanelLayoutTest.cpp — a property row fits inside its card, and a pane can reach all of its content
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  Three defects, all reported from the World Browser, all of them geometry rather than rendering:
//
//    · the slider ran off the card, off the window and past the edge of the screen. The row reserved 104 px for
//      a pill the kit drew at 118, then forced the slider to a 90 px minimum measured from wherever that left
//      off. What reached the screen was a track painted across the pill's unit cell and a control that could
//      not be grabbed at all;
//
//    · neither pane scrolled, so the lower half of a tall panel was unreachable. The Sky Atmosphere card alone
//      is taller than the pane on a normal window;
//
//    · dragging a slider dragged the WINDOW as well, because the panel's widgets are painted straight into the
//      window's draw list and ImGui therefore believes the whole body is empty background — and pressing empty
//      background is how a window is moved. That one is asserted in the gate rather than here, since it is a
//      property of the ImGui call sequence and not of any arithmetic.
//
//  Every assertion below is geometry the drawing code shares, not a screenshot of it.
//
