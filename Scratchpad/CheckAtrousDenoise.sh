# R7 gate: the edge-avoiding à-trous denoiser removes noise without removing detail.
#
# Three checks:
#   1. CPU harness  — a verbatim port of the shader arithmetic, asserting the behaviours a plain blur would FAIL:
#                     silhouettes and shadow boundaries survive, background does not bleed, energy is preserved,
#                     and the filter is an exact identity when disabled.
#   2. SPIR-V       — AtrousDenoise.slang compiles for Vulkan 1.2.
#   3. Agreement    — the constants the harness hard-codes still match the ones in the shader. Without this the
#                     port could silently drift and keep passing while the shader misbehaved.
