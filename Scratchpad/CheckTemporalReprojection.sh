# R7a gate: the running mean is reprojected through the motion vectors, and does so without smearing.
#
# Three checks:
#   1. CPU harness  — the reprojection rule ported from ResolveSurface(): inheritance across a pan, disocclusion
#                     restart on a normal or depth mismatch, off-screen rejection, and a measured noise reduction.
#   2. SPIR-V       — ReSTIRViewport.slang still compiles with the new binding.
#   3. Bindings     — the C++ binding map and the shader agree. A silent disagreement here would bind the texture
#                     table over the history surface image, which is the failure mode worth a dedicated check.
