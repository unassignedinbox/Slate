# ApplyImGuiPatches.ps1 — applies Slate's tab-shape patches to the vendored ImGui submodule.
#
# 🔴 `ExternalPackages/` is never edited by hand. The two patches below are the whole of Slate's
#    divergence from upstream ImGui, they are tracked in `Patches/`, and this script is the only thing
#    that applies them. A silently adjusted vendored dependency is a defect that reproduces on one
#    machine only — `14` §2 — so the divergence is a file a reader can open rather than a local edit.
#
# 🔴 Both patches default every member they add to 0.0f. An unpatched build and a patched build with
#    default style emit the same command stream, so applying these changes nothing until Slate opts in.

#    again, aborting a build whose tree was perfectly healthy. A sentinel is stable under stacking.
